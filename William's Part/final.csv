Andrew Grice’s article on how Boris Johnson might approach the next election overlooks the significant danger that nothing will change and just like the last four and a half years Brexit will continue to dominate our national life, dividing us and stultifying debate and preventing progress within this country.

Back in July 2018 you published a letter of mine around who was to blame for the then Brexit situation and I feel my final paragraph remains relevant unless we actively choose a different course.

“Even after we leave the EU ... the question will remain unresolved dividing the nation. The UK will be like Ireland after the civil war: divided for generations over what should have happened back at the peace conference in 1921. And, like Ireland only when those who lived through it are dead will the country be able to move forward.”

If we want to avoid repeating history then we must put Brexit behind us and refuse to fight yesterday’s battles again even if Johnson sees a rematch as his best route to victory.

I’m not suggesting that Johnson should be given a clear path. He should be challenged on what he’s done and is doing now on the economy, the pandemic, equality, feeding children – the list is endless – but we should not allow ourselves to be mired in the past his incompetence.

Outlaw the “B” word, concentrate on what the government promises and what it actually delivers and work to get a government committed to the many not the few by concentrating on the here and now.

Labour issues

While there are times when journalistic shorthand is unavoidable, I strongly object to your assertion about the Brexit deal that “Labour immediately threw their weight behind the government and said they would support it”.

The Labour leadership may have done so but a large majority of the party’s members believe that this is a terrible deal and would like to see our MPs defy the party whip, for the good of both country and party.

It must have given great comfort to our bumbling PM to have had Keir Starmer’s pledge to whip his party into voting for the “deal” even before it was struck or details published.

EU attachment

Among much of the nonsense our PM spouted in the wake of the “deal” was the declaration that the UK would remain “culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe”. The man simply loves the sound of his own voice.

As a Remainer I am completely culturally and emotionally attached to Europe. I do not accept that Brexiteers are, let alone wish to remain so. Then, how can we not remain “historically” attached? History is done. Strategically? I doubt it, though I very much hope so. But geologically? Goodness! I’d no idea that was up for grabs. How much has that weirdly unbelievable initiative cost us? We really should be told.

Under one in 10 young people in Scotland think the Brexit vote was a ""good result"", research has found.

More than two-thirds (70%) of almost 600 11 to 26-year-olds who took part in the Young Scot Your Thoughts on Brexit survey said the vote to leave the EU was ""not a good result"" with just 9% believing the opposite.

A further 11% said they are ""not bothered either way"" and 10% responded that they had not given it much thought.

More than half (55%) believe it will lead to fewer career opportunities and 47% think studying opportunities will fall, 42% said Brexit has already affected them, and nearly a fifth (19%) said it had made them change their plans or ambitions.

However, more than a third (35%) said it will not change their plans and 9% believe career opportunities will increase, with 6% predicting a rise in studying opportunities.

The head of Young Scot said the findings underline the importance of young people having a voice the Brexit negotiations.

Further results from the survey show more than half (56%) think Brexit will have a negative effect on their family life while 6% said the effect will be positive and 27% predicted no effect.

Around 28% of students said they are not sure how Brexit will affect them but, of those who think there will be an effect, more believe it will be negative (41%) than positive (5%).

Just under a third (32%) predict a negative impact on their rights while a fifth (20%) think their rights will not be affected and 4% think they will improve.

Around half of respondents (48%) believe Brexit will erode the rights of EU nationals, while 4% think it will have a positive impact.

More than half (58%) said co-operation on national security will be more difficult while one in 20 (5%) believe it will be easier.

Among the concerns respondents raised when questioned about EU benefits were travel and free movement, education and employment, funding, health and rights.

Other concerns included mobile phone roaming charges, trade and the economy.

Louise Macdonald, chief executive of Young Scot, said: ""Our research shows that the majority of young people in Scotland have concerns about the UK's future relationship with Europe.

""It's absolutely vital that political leaders across the UK work with young people to fully involve them in discussions about their future.

""Many young Scots fear that there will be a negative impact on their lives and opportunities following withdrawal from the EU; their ideas and priorities must be heard.""

The Scottish Government supported the survey which questioned 593 people aged 11-26 between November 2017 and March.","under one in 10 young people in Scotland think the vote to leave the EU was a ""good result"" more than two-thirds (70%) of almost 600 11 to 26-year-olds said the vote was ""not a good result"" more than half (55%) believe it will lead to fewer career opportunities."

An appeals tribunal found the political party, led at the time by Nigel Farage, failed to properly answer the information commissioner’s questions. It is now legally obliged to provide detailed answers to questions about how it spent political donations and used polling companies and data.

The ruling is the latest watchdog finding to cast a shadow over the 2016 EU referendum and to raise concerns about the use of political and social media data.

Last year the Electoral Commission found both the official Vote Leave campaign – in which Boris Johnson and Michael Gove played key roles – and the unofficial Leave.EU campaign guilty of breaking electoral law. The commission fined both campaigns and referred its findings to the police.

Facebook also came in for criticism from the information commissioner and was fined £500,000 in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal for allowing third party developers to access user information without sufficient consent. The latest ruling is a result of a separate Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) investigation into how political parties use data analytics to target voters. It was launched in response to public concern about the use of social media during the referendum, after the Observer’s initial investigation into the abuse of data and the work of Cambridge Analytica.

When the investigation opened in 2017, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said more than 30 organisations were under scrutiny. While some were cooperating, she said, “others are making it difficult.”

In the latest ruling, Judge Nicholas Wikeley criticised Ukip’s failure to cooperate with the ICO, saying: “Its answers arrived late and were brief and unsatisfactory, not least in being inconsistent with publicly available information previously supplied by Ukip itself. Overall, Ukip’s response gave the commissioner the clear impression that the party was not taking the request seriously.”

When the commissioner first wrote to Ukip, the party replied: “It turns out we hardly use data at all.”

It specifically denied using the services of Constituency Polling Ltd, which is linked to polling firm Survation, even though the Electoral Commission’s register showed that Ukip spent £186,613.13 with the company during the 2015 general election.

Ukip also spent a small sum – £72.00 – on the unofficial Leave.EU campaign during the referendum, and directed much larger sums to companies whose owner Arron Banks was a major Ukip donor and founder of Leave.EU. “Better for the Country”, which was used to finance Leave.EU, received £67,236 during the EU referendum and Rock Services Limited was paid £64,762.73 during the 2015 general election.

The National Crime Agency is investigating allegations of multiple criminal offences by Arron Banks and Leave.EU in the Brexit referendum. One focus of the investigations is £2m reported to have been lent to Better for the Country.

Banks and Elizabeth Bilney, who chaired the Leave.EU campaign, said they rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, and argued the investigation was motivated by political considerations.

Leave.EU and another Arron Banks firm, Eldon Insurance, were also fined over data law breaches in the referendum.

Ukip also later admitted in further correspondence to the data commissioner: “In the past we have used targeted ad [sic] on Facebook during the referendum and we have used the boost service for our ads. We have not granulated data any further than that.”

The commissioner has found that many political parties bought marketing lists and lifestyle information from data brokers “without sufficient due diligence” as to their activities. They also used third-party data analytics companies without checking if users had given consent for their personal information to be passed on and used for political purposes.

Ukip was specifically asked about its links to another organisation called NationBuilder, an online campaigning platform which the ICO said was used by up to 200 political parties or campaign groups during the 2017 general election. NationBuilder has a “match function” allowing parties to match their own databases with social media data from public profiles, which the regulator said could be happening without the people affected knowing. NationBuilder said the match function was optional and could be switched off by its clients.

In its appeal, Ukip argued the information commissioner did not have the power to make such demands on it. It also said it was “a relatively small, modestly funded organisation with largely part-time staff. Ukip does not have great resources and does the best it can with what it has.”

Ukip said: “This case concerned an information notice served on Ukip, which was unclear in its scope. As there were no existing legal authorities on how information notices should be interpreted, Ukip chose to appeal it. This judgment is the final determination in that matter and Ukip has since supplied the information required of it to the ICO.”",the ruling casts a shadow over the 2016 EU referendum and raises concerns about the use of political and social media data. last year the Electoral Commission found both the official Vote Leave campaign guilty of breaking electoral law.

The Brexit Party leader has been campaigning in Dartford and Gravesend today but three men with balaclavas are reported to have greeted him in Rochester

Nigel Farage 'stuck on Brexit bus due to people armed with milkshakes'

Nigel Farage was reportedly stuck on his Brexit Party campaign bus due to people nearby wearing balaclavas thought to have been armed with milkshakes.

Police are said to have been called to the scene in Rochester.

But later a Brexit Party spokesman confirmed that Mr Farage had left the bus after police spoke to the protesters.

Earlier this week the Brexit Party leader was doused in the milk-based drink while campaigning in Newcastle.

Today Mr Farage has been campaigning in Kent on a bus driven by Michael Botton, reports Kent Live.

Mr Botton told Kent Live: ""There are a couple of guys standing over there with milkshakes, they were going to throw them over him.

“But the police are there, we’ve spotted them and now Nigel isn’t getting off the bus.”

Three young men dressed in black with their hoods up and covering their faces with balaclavas were spotted at the back of the crowd.

Farage was said to be alerted and he was told not to get off the bus.

And two men enjoying iced coffees were photographed speaking to police liaison officers after they had shouted anti-Farage slogans.

A Brexit Party spokesman said: ""Nigel Farage arrived at Rochester to be greeted by 50-60 local supporters.

""Three anti-Brexit party activists turned up with milkshakes, they were laughed at and spoken to by the police and put their drinks down.

""Farage conducted a few interviews on the open topped bus then came down to speak to supporters and local campaigners.""

Mr Farage did not walk down streets as he had at previous stops.

Kent Live reporter at the scene Will Rider said: ""He was stuck on the bus for ages and wouldn't come off.

""Eventually he did come off but he only stepped about a metre away and chatted to some supporters.

""He got back on the bus very quickly.

""In all the other places he stopped off and walked down the high street.

""There was a Brexit stall on this high street but he didn't visit it.

""He's gone and everyone has left now.""

On the last day of campaigning he said: ""It's a big day tomorrow, a chance to stun the establishment.

""I don't know if the opinion polls are right but if they are the Brexit Party could win and it could win big. It could change the whole political agenda, I reckon that's pretty exciting.""

Mr Farage, whose Brexit Party have seen huge success in polling ahead of the voting tomorrow, said: ""...militant Remainers who do not hide their contempt for the demos – the people – and imagine that they can stop the march of a mass movement with a milkshake. Dream on.""

Mr Farage has been on the streets earlier today to meet voters ahead of the European elections taking place tomorrow.

He is said to have largely received a positive reception in Dartford and Gravesend.

Theresa May has told the House of Commons that her trade deal with the EU was better than the one eventually struck by Boris Johnson.

The former prime minister said that she would vote later today in favour of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached by her successor on Christmas Eve, but told MPs that she had offered them a “better deal” in 2019.

And she took a swipe at hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches who judge the success of a deal by the extent to which it frees the UK from entanglement in multilateral organisations like the EU, declaring: “Sovereignty does not mean isolationism.”

Ms May said she was “disappointed” in the deal Mr Johnson has reached on services and his failure to achieve the “groundbreaking” settlement for the financial sector which she had promised. She urged him to return to the negotiating table and fight for better arrangements for the sector which makes up 80 per cent of the UK economy.

“We have a deal in trade, which benefits the EU, but not a deal in services, which would have benefited the UK,” she told MPs.

Ms May also raised concerns about the security arrangements in Mr Johnson’s deal, which she suggested could harm the fight against modern slavery and child abduction.

And she said that the complex structure of joint committees and panels constructed to oversee the implementation and interpretation of Mr Johnson’s deal ”without any formal reference to this parliament” meant that the Christmas Eve agreement would not “excise the EU from our lives”.

Despite her misgivings, she urged MPs to back the Bill ratifying the deal. In an apparent reference to the rebellions which forced her from power, she said it was time “to push aside personal and party political interests, which sadly too many have followed in the past” in favour of the national interest.

Ms May’s proposed deal, which would have seen the UK remain temporarily in the EU’s customs union, was rejected by hardline Tory Brexiteers as “Brexit in name only” and triggered the resignation of Mr Johnson and David Davis from her cabinet.

After a succession of humiliating Commons defeats at the hands of Tory rebels and opposition parties, she resigned and saw her former foreign secretary replace her in 10 Downing Street.

Speaking in the one-day debate on the Bill ratifying Mr Johnson’s deal, Ms May said she had heard with “incredulity” that Labour was now planning to vote in favour of the PM’s agreement with Brussels.

The former PM said: “I welcome this deal and I will be supporting it today and I welcome the fact that the official opposition will be supporting this deal.

“But I did listen with some incredulity to what the leader of the opposition said.

“He said he wanted a better deal. He had the opportunity in early 2019, when there was the opportunity of a better deal on the table, and he voted against it.”

Ms May said that the zero-tariff, zero quota arrangements which Mr Johnson boasts of as the main achievement of his deal were already contained in the political declaration which she agreed with Brussels in 2018.

And she raised concerns about the security aspects of Mr Johnson’s deal, which denies the UK direct access to EU crime-fighting databases, such as the Schengen Information System II for security and border management.

“I hope in operational terms, in practice, we will see little change to the ability to investigate as a result of the good relationships which have been built up, but I do say that I think the EU has made a mistake in not allowing us access to SIS II,” she told MPs.

“I think that is something where we should aim to find some resolution of in the future, because it is an important database, it does help us in our fight on modern slavery and child abduction and identifying criminals across our borders.”

Ms May added: “One area where I am disappointed in the deal is in services. It is no longer the case that UK service providers will have the automatic right of access to provide services across the EU. They will have to abide by the individual rules of state.

“And the key area is financial services. In 2018 in Mansion House I said that we wanted to work to get a financial services deal in the future treaty arrangement, and that that would be truly groundbreaking. It would have been. But sadly it has not been achieved.

“We have a deal in trade, which benefits the EU, but not a deal in services, which would have benefited the UK.”

Despite Mr Johnson’s calls for Britain to move on from Brexit, she called on the government to resume negotiations “with alacrity and vigour” to improve the UK’s position on services.

In comments apparently aimed at the hardline Brexiteers who made her premiership a misery, Ms May said: ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism.

“And it is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world.

“And if the United Kingdom is going to play the role that I believe it should play in not just upholding, but encouraging and promoting the rules-based international order and in ensuring that we promote the interests and value and strengthen multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organisation, we must never allow ourselves to think - as I fear some in this House do - that sovereignty means isolationism.”",theresa may says her trade deal with the EU is better than the one eventually struck by Boris Johnson. the former pm said she would vote later today in favour of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached by her successor on Christmas Eve. but she told MPs that she had offered them a 'better deal' in 2019.

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove should be imprisoned for ""lies"" they told during the Brexit referendum campaign, Alan Sugar has said.

The businessman and host of The Apprentice said the leading Brexiteers should face criminal action for claiming there would be £350m more to spend on the NHS after Brexit.

He suggested the result of the Brexit referendum should be declared ""void"" because the public had been ""totally misled"" by anti-EU campaigners.

Speaking during a House of Lords debate on a second Brexit referendum, Lord Sugar, who sits as a crossbench peer after quitting the Labour Party, initially said a fresh vote would be a ""complete farce"".

But referring to the 2016 poll, he added: ""However, there is a very good argument to void that vote if it can be concluded that the public were totally misled and it is my belief that a large section of the British public were misled, informing their decision to vote to leave.""

Describing the business world ""where all comments and forecasts ... had to be scrutinised line by line by auditors and lawyers in a very tough due diligence and verification process"", he said similar standards should be applied to politicians.

Dominic Raab raises fears of no-deal Brexit, blaming EU's negotiating stance

He said: ""No such process exists for claims politicians make.

""In some cases misleading shareholders had resulted in prosecution, imprisonment.

""Applying the public company principle, it should follow that those people who will be responsible for putting this country into five to 10 years of post-Brexit turmoil based on lies should be in prison or at least prosecuted.

""Such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for the £350m lie they put on the red bus.""

During the campaign, the Vote Leave group toured the country in a bus emblazoned with the words: ""We send the EU £350m a week. Let's fund our NHS instead.""

The idea of a second Brexit referendum is very likely to be put before Britain's parliament again although the government remains opposed to any new plebiscite, the British finance minister said on Friday.

Philip Hammond said he hoped parliament would break the Brexit impasse by passing a deal by the end of June, potentially ending the calls for a new referendum, and there was a ""good chance"" of a breakthrough in talks with the opposition Labour Party.

""I remain optimistic that over the next couple of months we will get a deal done,"" he told reporters in Washington where he is attending meetings at the International Monetary Fund.

But a second referendum could not be ruled out.

""It's a proposition that could and, on all the evidence, is very likely to be put to parliament at some stage,"" Hammond said.

Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to get her own Conservative Party behind the Brexit divorce deal she agreed with other European Union leaders last year, forcing her to ask the bloc for a delay and to start talks with Labour about how to break the impasse in parliament.

Many Labour lawmakers are pressing their leader Jeremy Corbyn to demand a new referendum in talks with the government.

Hammond said that while the government was opposed to a new public vote, other Labour demands - such as a customs union with the EU - were up for debate.

Hammond said about six months would be needed to hold a referendum, so if parliament voted in a couple of months' time to make one a condition of approving a Brexit deal, there would be no time before Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31.

One of May's most pro-EU ministers, Hammond has faced criticism from Brexit supporters for saying Britain should stay close to the bloc. He angered them again recently by describing another Brexit referendum as a ""perfectly credible proposition"".

""(A second referendum) in the end is an issue about parliament and parliamentary numbers, and where the Labour Party ends up on this, as the Labour Party itself is deeply divided on this issue and at some point will have to decide on where it stands,"" Hammond said.

Parliament has previously rejected the idea of a new referendum and other possible solutions the Brexit impasse.",a second referendum is very likely to be put before parliament again. the government remains opposed to any new plebiscite. many labour lawmakers are pressing their leader Jeremy corbyn to demand a new referendum.

MEPs from nearly every country in the EU have signed a heartfelt joint letter to the British public asking them to reconsider their decision to leave the bloc to prevent an “unfolding Brexit disaster”.

The cross-party message, which was organised by an Austrian MEP and signed by 129 of his colleagues, says the continent is “looking with growing anxiety” across the Channel to events occurring in Britain.

“We are reluctant to intervene in your domestic politics, but we cannot help but notice that the opinion polls show a growing number of voters who want an opportunity to reconsider the Brexit decision, now that it is clear that Brexit is very different to the promises made by the Leave campaign nearly three years ago,” the MEPs say.

The representatives – who come from across the conservative, liberal, socialist and green groups – add that though they respect and regret the decision of the UK to leave, “any British decision to remain in the EU would be warmly welcomed by us and we would work with you to reform and improve the European Union, so that it works better in the interests of all citizens”.

The intervention comes amid turmoil in Westminster over Brexit, with MPs set to reject the deal negotiated by the prime minister.

The only country whose MEPs all passed on signing the letter was Cyprus, the union’s third smallest member – but it otherwise draws signatories from every part of the continent.

“We have greatly appreciated the enormous impact British politicians and citizens have contributed to the European project over the last 40 years. We would miss the extraordinary expertise of our British colleagues,” the MEPs say, adding that they would support the withdrawal of Article 50.

“We ask you to reconsider to leave our union in the interest of the next generation of young people, British and Europeans, who will lose out on the opportunities of living, loving and working together. Brexit will weaken all of us. We want you to stay. Together, we are stronger and together we can build a stronger Europe.”

Notable MEPs on the list include Udo Bullmann, the leader of the socialist group in the parliament, and Philippe Lamberts, the Green group leader. It was also signed by Elmar Brok, the German MEP from Angela Merkel’s CDU group who sits on the parliament’s Brexit steering group.

It was put together by Josef Weidenholzer, from the Austrian centre-left SPOe.

British Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said of the letter: “It’s touching to hear from so many MEPs, from so many countries and across the party divides that they value the Brits and want us to stay.

“They respect our decision, but have been clear all along: we are stronger when we work together inside the EU.”

The full letter reads:

Dear citizens of the United Kingdom

As friends of your country, we are looking with growing anxiety at the unfolding of Brexit disaster that will be harmful for both Britain and Europe. We are reluctant to intervene in your domestic politics, but we cannot help but notice that the opinion polls show a growing number of voters who want an opportunity to re-consider the Brexit decision, now that it is clear that Brexit is very different to the promises made by the Leave campaign nearly three years ago.

Nevertheless we regret the decision made by the British people we understand the need to respect it. Leaving without a deal would be a disaster for everyone involved – UK and EU citizens alike. Any British decision to remain in the EU would be warmly welcomed by us and we would work with you to reform and improve the European Union, so that it works better in the interests of all citizens.

Indeed, should the UK decide to withdraw the article 50 letter received by the President of the European Council, then we as Members of the European Parliament would support it. We have greatly appreciated the enormous impact British politicians and citizens have contributed to the European project over the last 40 years. We would miss the extraordinary expertise of our British colleagues.

We ask you to reconsider to leave our Union in the interest of the next generation of young people, British and Europeans, who will lose out on the opportunities of living, loving and working together. Brexit will weaken all of us. We want you to stay. Together, we are stronger and together we can build a stronger Europe.","the cross-party message was organised by an Austrian MEP and signed by 129 of his colleagues. the intervention comes amid turmoil in Westminster over Brexit, with MPs set to reject the deal negotiated by the prime minister."

If Ruth Davidson weren’t on maternity leave, it’s tempting to believe the former Territorial Army Signaller would by now have commandeered a tank and be rumbling down the M6 with the gun pointed firmly in the direction of the ERG. Davidson’s contempt for Boris Johnson and his cohorts is absolute and withering. Her no-nonsense, pragmatic Conservatism does not allow for the preening self-indulgence of the Tory far-right.

But Davidson is with baby Finn, and this has left something of a hole in the Brexit debate, at both a Scottish and UK level. The leader of Scotland’s Tories broke her silence this week when she took to Twitter to praise Theresa May’s “cojones of steel” and pledge her full support for the PM ahead of the confidence vote, but otherwise her voice has been conspicuously, if understandably, absent.

This doesn’t mean the Scottish Conservatives are dormant, or that Project Ruth is in abeyance. The party at Holyrood remains fully signed up to Davidson’s liberal, One Nation stance. And if there isn’t a tank on its way to London, there are certainly a few rhetorical exocets being fired. “When I look at what’s going on down south, I feel appalled and embarrassed,” one prominent MSP tells me. “I hate the English party. I’m horrified at the support for no deal being expressed by party members. I’ve stopped reading ConservativeHome.”

If this sounds like a temporary huff, the fault lines run deeper. Senior Scottish Tories believe the UK is on a trajectory to crash out of the EU without a deal, and that this could be fatal for the unity of the United Kingdom. I understand that they will back any measure that prevents no deal, and could publicly express support for a second referendum – if May’s deal can’t pass parliament – as early as next week. I’m told both Davidson and her stand-in Jackson Carlaw are signed up to this position. “No deal would be disastrous and jeopardise the union so we will reluctantly have to go back to the country and ask them,” says a source.

The Scottish Tories would potentially favour a two-question referendum, along the lines of 1) Do you want to leave the European Union or remain on existing terms?, and 2) If you want to leave should we do so on the basis of the deal that has been agreed or leave without a deal?

There is tremendous anger that the party at Holyrood has been placed in this position, for a number of reasons. One is that support for a second EU referendum will make it much harder to argue against a second independence referendum in a few years’ time. “We would have to accept if there is a pro-indy majority after the 2021 [Holyrood] election there will be a second referendum,” says a source. On the upside, this would allow Davidson to frame the campaign as a binary choice between more constitutional disruption from the SNP or allowing the new UK settlement to bed down with the Conservatives.

The travails of Brexit have fractured the previous unity of the Scottish party. The group of MPs at Westminster were once seen as being loyal to Davidson, and to owe their seats to her popularity, but some have split away either to speak out against May’s deal or to support the more extreme end of the ERG position. “Project Ruth feels very much like a Holyrood project now,” says an MSP.

This may well have disruptive long-term consequences. Scottish sources say that if the UK party elects an English nationalist leader – ie someone from within the ERG group – it would strain the bonds to breaking point. It would also undermine the 2021 campaign – “if the Westminster Tories are as divisive and newsworthy at that point then it doesn’t matter what we do, we’re fucked,” according to a key member of Team Davidson.

This, in turn, could lead to a formal breach, with the Scottish party choosing to break the link with the UK party and become independent. “An increasing number of people at the top table think we need our independence,” says a senior MSP. The belief is that while Davidson would be unlikely to drive the split, she will leave the party in such a position that her successor will do so.

It remains unclear whether Brexit will destroy the integrity of the UK. But it will be a tremendous irony if one of the first institutions to fall apart under its strain is the Conservative Party itself.","Davidson's contempt for Boris Johnson and his cohorts is absolute and withering. if there isn't a tank on its way to London, there are a few rhetorical exocets being fired. senior tories believe the UK is on a trajectory to crash out of the EU without a deal."
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/8mxbip/nick_clegg_brexiteers_are_right_to_panic_theyve/,https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/nick-clegg-the-brexiteers-are-right-to-panic/,Nick Clegg: Brexiteers are right to panic,"In politics, if you want to understand your enemies listen hard to their tone. The tone of your opponents normally tells you a lot more about what they’re really thinking than what they say. And the tone of the Brexiteers is increasingly brittle, angry and panicky.

It isn’t just the – now frequent – demented headlines on the front page of Paul Dacre’s Daily Mail (“traitors”, “saboteurs”, “enemies of the people”). It isn’t just the – now frequent – self-absorbed rants from Dominic Cummings, the political apparatchik who helped to run the Brexit campaign.

Cabinet Ministers and senior MPs are at it too. Liam Fox says that the BBC “would rather see Britain fail”. Steve Baker claimed (and later apologised for claiming) that Treasury officials were fiddling the figures to keep the UK in a customs union. Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, of being an “enemy of Brexit”. Daniel Hannan MEP says Remainer MPs want to keep Britain in a “subservient status”. Ian Duncan Smith declared that “this Irish stuff” about the border has been made up to block Brexit. And so on.

“The Brexiteers can rant all they like, but perhaps they should have understood the rules of the game before playing Russian roulette with the future of the country.”

So the tone is revealing – they’re panicking, and the panic is rising with each passing day. The question to ask is why? Surely now that “independence day” on 29 March next year is so tantalisingly close, a tone of growing confidence – not fury and panic – should infuse the language of the Brexiters?

Tonal difference

One revealing clue emerged last week during a toe-curlingly awkward appearance by Suella Braverman, a recently appointed Minister to the Department for Exiting the European Union, in front of the House of Commons Brexit Committee. In evidence submitted to MPs, she admitted that the Government would have to hand over a £40bn Brexit cheque to the EU without any guarantee that a good trade deal would be forthcoming in return.

Predictably enough, the Brexit press and Conservative Brexiteers harrumphed their disapproval. Cummings spluttered that the country will not forgive Ministers when it realises they have “handed over tens of billions for f**k all”.

But have these Brexiters not read Article 50? It is crystal clear: the EU is only legally committed to negotiating the exit of a departing Member State “taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union”. In other words, the legally binding terms of exit – notably what money will change hands – are not contingent on a detailed agreement on future relations between the departing country and the EU. The Brexiteers can rant all they like, but perhaps they should have understood the rules of the game before playing Russian roulette with the future of the country.

And they’re panicking – perhaps rightly – because they know that voters will indeed be livid when they realise that, far from delivering a bonanza of £350m per week for the NHS, Brexit involves payments to the EU without any guarantees about the future. If I was one of the anti-Brexit campaign groups, I would already be printing the leaflets that highlight how British taxpayers are being fleeced by the dishonest incompetence of the very people claiming to stand up for Britain.

What the experts say

And then there’s the sheer weight of evidence and expertise which, day by day and week by week, continues to weigh against the self-harming damage of the whole Brexit adventure.

In the space of just a few days, the Governor of the Bank of England announced that the average British household was already £900 worse off before Brexit has even occurred, the head of HM Revenue and Customs revealed that the Brexiteer’s favoured “max fac” customs arrangement would cost the economy a whopping £20bn per year, and the Government itself published plans to turn a 13-mile section of the M20 into a giant car park for thousands of lorries to cope with the severe tailbacks after Brexit (a kind of motorway “Mad Max Dystopia” which David Davis said would never happen).

By now, everyone knows that for the high priests of Brexit, leaving the EU is a faith immune to logical argument. Pesky experts are loftily dismissed as dumb puppets of “the establishment”. Science, data and research are brushed aside by a theological belief in the virtue of Brexit.

“All the signs point in one direction: the Brexiteers are panicking – and they’re right to panic.”

But eventually the facts start speaking for themselves. No one in the country now believes that Brexit is as easy, uncomplicated, rapid or beneficial as they were told in the Summer of 2016. Arrogance and bluster are colliding with the cold realities of economics in an interdependent world.

And – crucially – there is growing evidence that British voters are developing real doubts of their own.

A recent analysis of YouGov’s rolling polls suggests that a million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts, with buyer’s remorse particularly marked amongst voters under the age of 40, especially women and working-class C2DE voters. Other polls have shown a marked increase in pessimism about the impact of Brexit on the NHS.

So all the signs point in one direction: the Brexiteers are panicking – and they’re right to panic. They may have all the tabloids on their side. They may be able to call on the deep pockets of Eurosceptic hedge fund managers. But they’re running out of excuses and they can feel that momentum is starting to ebb away from their cause.

That is why they are now turning on each other like rats in a sack, frantically looking to blame anyone and anything but themselves. They deserve no pity. It is almost two years since they won their unexpected victory. They have failed to deliver the utopia they promised to the country. Now they must be held to account.

@nick_clegg","the tone of the Brexiteers is increasingly brittle, angry and panicky. it isn’t just the demented headlines on the front page of the daily mail. it isn’t just the self-absorbed rants from Dominic Cummings, the political apparatchik who helped to run the Brexit campaign."

""I feel like a heist has been carried out on my country,"" one of the men behind the billboard campaign that is sweeping the UK told Euronews.

With three friends, he has pasted tweets and quotes on billboards across the UK, holding politicians to account for what they have said about Brexit.

""It's like we watched the robbers escape with the money and now we're going after them armed with ladders, roller brushes and damning statements from our leaders,"" he added.

'Brexiters promised the earth and got away with it'

The four ""working dads"", who wish to remain anonymous, came up with the idea for the Led By Donkeys project at the pub and ""borrowed advertising real estate from companies who could afford it"" for their first ""guerilla"" posters.

They started out with tweets from former Prime Minister David Cameron and ex-Secretary of State David Davis, going on to feature those of Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg.

""We were angry that Brexiters promised the earth and got away with it,"" the spokesman said.

Their wrath hasn't been reserved for Tory politicians, with a recent billboard in London taking a swipe at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose critics say has failed to make his position on Brexit known.

Such was the campaign's popularity that the group set up a crowdfunding page, which garnered £50,000 (€57,079) in 36 hours. The total stood at just over £156,554 (€178,721) at the time of writing.

""We spend the money responsibly,"" the group's spokesman said. ""Our aim is to remind people that our leaders said the EU would crumble before Britain's awesome negotiating power when what actually happened is the other countries showed a united front.""

They estimate that, on average, the rental of a billboard costs £1,000 and this is what the group has pledged to spend the money on.

Indeed, one issue with their so-called guerilla tactics was that the owners of the advertising space took down their posters, often within a day of them being put up.

'We get a demand every two or three minutes'

Led By Donkeys has put posters up across England, Wales and Scotland and would like to further their efforts to Northern Ireland.

They do recognise that their small team has its limits, though, as they are dads, working full time, and running the campaign ""in that order"".

""It's difficult, we get a demand every two or three minutes,"" the spokesman explained.

The group's wish for the future is simple — they don't want any politicians to be able to leave a TV studio or meeting with constituents without being held to account on Brexit.

""We'll react according to the political reality that emerges in the next few weeks,"" they said of their next steps.

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/86ur39/brexit_campaign_was_totally_illegal_claims/,https://www.channel4.com/news/brexit-campaign-was-totally-illegal-claims-whistleblower,"Brexit campaign was ‘totally illegal’, claims whistleblower","A Brexit campaigner has told Channel 4 News that Vote Leave cheated in the 2016 referendum by over-spending. But the prime minister’s political secretary says the allegations are “factually incorrect and misleading”, and outs the accuser as gay.

A whistle-blower, who says he was “outed” as gay by the Prime Minister’s political secretary in a row over cheating claims in the Brexit campaign, has claimed that the EU Referendum “wasn’t legitimate”.

In an interview with Channel 4 News, Shahmir Sanni, who helped run the BeLeave offshoot campaign, said that “people have been lied to,” adding: “I know… that Vote Leave cheated.”

He said: “Leaving the European Union, I agree with. But I don’t agree with losing what it means to be British in that process; losing what it means to follow the rules; losing what it means to be quite literally a functioning democracy.”

Theresa May’s political secretary Stephen Parkinson has been accused of “outing” Sanni yesterday after he was asked to respond to claims of cheating by Brexiteers. Parkinson says the two had been in a relationship for 18-months, which he then implies coloured his judgement of events.

Channel 4 News can also reveal that Sanni went to the Electoral Commission with two other pro-Brexit campaigning friends on Thursday with their evidence.

They told the Commission in detail why they think Vote Leave broke the law during the Referendum, and exceeded the legal spending limits.

Earlier last week their lawyers gave the Commission signed statements from the three whistle-blowers. Channel 4 News has seen a duplicate of the 46-page account prepared by two top QCs, and three thick ring-binders of supporting documents.

The allegations

The cheating row centres around the links between Vote Leave and third-party campaign group BeLeave.

Under election laws, Vote Leave was only allowed to spend £7m on its campaign. But there were scores of other separate campaign groups who could each spend up to £700,000, if they registered as permitted participants.

However, spending by each of these groups had to remain truly independent, and not directed by, the main designated campaigns.

Sanni tells Channel 4 News he was initially a Vote Leave outreach volunteer. But he claimed Stephen Parkinson then assigned him to another Brexit group called BeLeave, where he worked with the group’s founder, Darren Grimes.

BeLeave was based inside the Vote Leave headquarters and Grimes was photographed holding a Vote Leave poster on the day of the Referendum.

Sanni says that he and Grimes always reported to Stephen Parkinson.

“There was no time where anything BeLeave did didn’t go through Stephen,” Sanni said. “Any sort of article that I posted or an article that I wrote, I would run it through Stephen. I would say ‘is this OK?’.”

“This was after we had become a separate organisation – I sent Stephen a draft of my speech, and said ‘Hey, what do you think?’ I sought advice, as did Darren.”

Together, they claim they worked hand in glove with Parkinson.

In the last ten days of the campaign, Vote Leave donated a total of £625,000 to Grimes, who was registered as a permitted participant. The donations went directly to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ (AIQ).

Sanni claims that Grimes was not truly independent of Vote Leave and was not in control of how the money was spent.

He claims Grimes and BeLeave were used by Vote Leave to get around limits on how much they could legally spend. If true, they could have overspent by almost ten per cent.

Documents seen by Channel 4 News show multiple links between AIQ and Cambridge Analytica’s parent company SCL.

Speaking about the donation, Sanni said: “When Darren told me that it was almost £700,000, the first thing I asked was ‘OK, so can I get my, you know, some of my travel expenses refunded, reimbursed?’,” he told Channel 4 News. “I didn’t have a job, I had just come out of graduation and I was volunteering.

“So I asked for money and Darren said ‘No I don’t think we can… the only way for them to give it to us is if they give it to AIQ.’ And that’s where at first I was like oh that’s a bit odd…”

Asked whether they could have refused to spend the money on AIQ, Sanni said: “We didn’t ever feel like we had that level of control. That’s what I mean, we never felt like we had control over the or, over the organisation itself…

“We were delegated responsibilities … but in terms of sort of money, we never had a say over that. We never had control over that.”

He claimed: “In effect they used BeLeave to over-spend, and not just by a small amount… Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn’t legal…”

“They say that it wasn’t coordinated, but it was. And so the idea that… the campaign was legitimate is false.”

The responses

Tonight, Stephen Parkinson issued a “personal statement” to Channel 4 News:

“I have seen the statements issued by Shahmir and his lawyers, and am saddened by them. They are factually incorrect and misleading. My statement to Channel 4 News and The Observer was issued in my personal capacity and was solely a response to the serious and untrue allegations made against me by Shahmir, Chris Wylie, and others.

“It would be surprising if Shahmir, Mr Wylie, or those advising them thought I would be able to defend myself against those allegations without revealing my relationship with Shahmir. Sadly, the allegations they have chosen to make are so serious that I have been compelled to do so. I cannot see how our relationship, which was ongoing at the time of the referendum and which is a material fact in the allegations being made, could have remained private once Shahmir decided to publicise his false claims in this way.

“The matters raised in tonight’s Channel 4 News programme are already with the Electoral Commission.

“At the relevant time during the referendum period, the Commission advised Vote Leave that it was permissible to make a donation in the way it proposed to do to BeLeave.

“Twice since the referendum the Commission has investigated this matter, and twice it has found no evidence of wrongdoing. A third investigation into the same issue is currently taking place.

“The Electoral Commission has not contacted me in relation to any of these inquiries, but I will of course be happy to assist in them if they wish me to do so.

“I firmly deny the allegations in the programme. I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations on the Vote Leave campaign, and am confident that I stayed within the law and strict spending rules at all times.”

A solicitor for Vote Leave said: “Vote Leave has twice been cleared on this matter by the Electoral Commission. There are a number of new accusations and allegations being made in what you have sent us. While many of them seem irrelevant or trivial, some are serious and potentially damaging to the reputations of those caught up in those allegations. As has been the case throughout, Vote Leave is obligated to review – to the extent it can after this long elapsed period since the referendum – all such allegations, and is doing so. We will as appropriate share any relevant findings with the Electoral Commission, again as we have always done.”

Lawyers for AggregateIQ said: “AggregateIQ is a digital advertising, web and software development company based in Canada. It is and has always been 100% Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates. It has never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.

“All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate. The services carried out by AggregateIQ for Vote Leave were in accordance with the instructions of Vote Leave. The services carried out for BeLeave were in accordance with the instructions of BeLeave. The accounts were kept separate at all times and there was no overlap or merging in any way.”

EU officials involved with Brexit negotiations privately considered aspects of Theresa May’s approach “insane” and “pathetic”, a new behind-the-scenes documentary shows.

BBC camera crews were given access to Brexit officials in the European parliament to make Brexit: Behind Closed Doors, a two-part series focusing on the team around Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator.

It shows officials having completely lost confidence in the UK’s ability to negotiate, with frustration regularly boiling over at behaviour emanating from the government in London.

In one telling scene, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, says his team needs someone “stable, available and reliable” on the British side to hold discussions with.

Mr Verhofstadt sarcastically replies: “We can’t ask too much of Britain, don’t overdo it.”

In another scene, Mr Verhofstadt’s chief of staff Guillaume McLaughlin reacts with disbelief when he is told that a Brexit deal is off because Ms May could not clear it with DUP leader Arlene Foster.

“What the f**k is wrong with her. That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.

The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.

On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.

The officials agreed that Mr Davis did not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues that bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.

“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr McLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.

Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr McLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k off!” at the screen when the prime minister claims she is working hard to get a deal.

The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.

Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.

Elmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.

“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”

On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.

After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, top aide Ms Rettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”

The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.","a new behind-the-scenes documentary focuses on the team around Guy Verhofstadt, the european parliament's Brexit coordinator. it shows officials privately considered aspects of Theresa May's approach 'insane' and 'pathetic'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ajyabw/the_will_of_the_people_on_brexit_was_not_fixed/,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/25/will-of-the-people-brexit-june-2016-leavers,The ‘will of the people’ on Brexit was not fixed for all time in June 2016 | Jonathan Freedland,"They have only one argument left. Back in the spring of 2016, the Brexiteers were promising sunshine and riches, untrammelled sovereignty and £350m a week: all the ice-cream of EU membership and none of the spinach. We would head out into the world and recover our destiny as a global trading nation, with more money in our pockets and independence in our hearts. You don’t hear much of that kind of talk these days, not when Airbus warns it could pull out of the UK – taking its 125,000 direct and indirect jobs with it – Sony relocates its European HQ from London to Amsterdam, and the carmaker Bentley says baldly: “It’s Brexit that’s the killer.” Instead the pro-leave case now boils down to one argument: it may be rough – “We won’t be able to get certain foods like bananas or tomatoes,” in the words of one senior Brexiteer, confident our Blitz spirit will get us through the coming storm – but we have to do it. We have no choice. It is the will of the people, and that will must be done.

Theresa May is the most dogged exponent of this view. A remainer in 2016, she cannot bring herself to make a positive case for Brexit. Instead, she repeats over and over that we are compelled to leave because that is what the British people voted for. Any deviation would be a betrayal. We are a man taking off his socks, bracing himself to walk barefoot across hot coals – for no better reason than he promised he would.

Those whose ears are attuned to the echoes of the last century will recoil somewhat from this language of the “will of the people” and “betrayal”: such rhetoric has an unhappy history. But putting the language aside, is the logic of the argument sound? Are the leavers right that Brexit is compulsory because of the 2016 vote?

Some pro-Europeans like to escape the question by insisting that the referendum was only “advisory” and that the 52% figure is illusory, in that only 37% of the electorate actually voted to leave. I don’t have much patience for that reasoning. The referendum was not viewed at the time as a glorified consultation exercise, and the rules are the rules: 50% plus one of those who turned out was enough to win.

On its face, then, the popular will from 2016 is clear: we voted to leave. What’s standing in the way – threatening to betray the will of the people, as May would see it – is parliament. Note arch-Brexiteer Suella Braverman telling Question Time on Thursday that we are in this mess thanks to a bunch of “self-appointed MPs” bent on stopping our exit.

That phrase passed without a murmur of dissent, and yet it’s absurd. MPs are not self-appointed. They were elected in June 2017 in a general election that itself expressed the “will of the people”, producing a hung parliament deadlocked on the issue of Brexit. True, the two main party manifestos promised to honour the 2016 vote. But all the same, voters chose to return hundreds of pro-remain MPs, from Ken Clarke to David Lammy, who did not pretend their views had changed, regardless of their official party platforms. The result was enough pro-remain MPs to form a blocking majority against Brexit. Braverman would have been more honest had she said that we are in this mess because the people’s will has demanded two contradictory things on two separate occasions – and admitted that, of the two, it’s the MPs chosen in 2017 who have the fresher mandate.

But let’s say you decide that 2016 trumps 2017, that the referendum somehow represents the purer democratic choice. You still have a problem. Because it’s not obvious that either of the Brexits currently on offer – May’s deal or a no-deal crash-out – truly represents the will of the people, as expressed in the referendum. After all, neither of those Brexits were on the ballot paper. The question asked only if people wanted to leave the European Union. It made no mention of the single market or customs union. There might have been a different answer if it had.

That gap between actual Brexit and the Brexit voted on in 2016 becomes wider if you factor in not just the wording of the question, but the campaign. Leavers did not warn that their option would entail a £39bn divorce settlement or losing our say on EU rules that would still apply to us. Nor did they advise stockpiling essential food and medicine or gird us to take the “hit” of massive job losses, as they do now. Again, there might have been a different result if they had. Either way, the notion that a 52% vote for a hypothetical, pain-free Brexit translates into an unbreakable mandate for an actually existing Brexit is shaky at best.

May likes to speak of the inviolability of referendum verdicts as if it is a timeless, universal principle. Indeed, in a speech earlier this month she had planned to say that no referendum in UK history had ever been challenged, citing the 1997 decision to establish a Welsh assembly as an example where a narrow outcome was respected on all sides. The trouble is, it wasn’t. The Conservatives opposed the legislation that would have enacted the Welsh result. Among those “self-appointed MPs” all too willing to betray the will of the people on that occasion was May herself, along with Brexiteers John Redwood, Liam Fox, Bill Cash and the rest of the gang. It seems referendums are not so sacred after all.

Ah, but surely May, Redwood and friends are allowed to change their minds? In the words of that great sage David Davis: “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.” A democratic decision is not etched in stone, fixed for evermore. It is dynamic, with voters and indeed their elected representatives allowed to change their minds in the light of changed facts.

We know that May, for one, believes in that principle. If the will of the people were truly inviolable, she would have felt compelled to honour the people’s 2015 instruction to govern for five years with a Tory majority. Instead, she had no qualms about disobeying that instruction – betraying it, even – and calling a snap election just two years later, one that would see the people issue a new instruction, directing the Tories to rule with no majority.

Perhaps conscious of the weakness of their logic, the will-of-the-people crowd have one last, emotional card to play. Think of it as their very own Project Fear. Betraying the referendum, they say, will empower the far right. But, as the Labour MP Jess Phillips likes to put it, since when did we give the far right a “veto over British democracy”? If we had let them have the casting vote, homosexuality would still be illegal in this country, there would be no black people, and we’d never have gone to war in 1939.

What’s more, most of today’s Brexiteers would have shuddered if you’d have suggested a decade ago that Britain’s foreign policy should be determined on the basis of what might best prevent jihadism winning new, radicalised recruits. They’d have called it appeasement. So why do they think Britain’s European policy should now be determined on the basis of what might prevent “Tommy Robinson” winning recruits radicalised by a supposed Brexit betrayal?

The key point is that a sovereign nation, one truly in control of its destiny, is not bound by such restraints. Not by foreign powers, nor even by the decisions of its own recent past. To think again is not a betrayal of democracy. It is an assertion of it.","the pro-leave case now boils down to one argument: it is the will of the people. theresa may cannot bring herself to make a positive case for Brexit. putting the language aside, is the logic of the argument sound?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/8d3pxi/each_brexit_scenario_will_leave_britain_worse_off/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/each-brexit-scenario-will-leave-britain-worse-off-study-finds,"Each Brexit scenario will leave Britain worse off, study finds","Each of the government’s four Brexit scenarios, including a bespoke deal, would leave Britain poorer and cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds each week, analysis has shown.

The study for the thinktank Global Future by Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College, London, found that a bespoke deal, the government’s preferred option, would have a net negative fiscal impact of about £40bn a year.

Polling commissioned for study by Populus, which is run by David Cameron’s former strategy chief Andrew Cooper, found that voters, even those who backed Brexit, feared that leaving the European Union would come at “too high a price”.

The analysis came as the government braced itself for defeats in parliament on Wednesday, including over its plans to take the UK out of the customs union, as the EU withdrawal bill returns to the House of Lords.

Nine senior Conservatives, including two former cabinet ministers, are among those who have put their names to a series of cross-party amendments aimed at persuading Theresa May to rethink her position.

The amendment giving parliament a vote on staying in a customs union, which is almost certain to pass, would mean MPs will get a say on the contentious issue despite the government’s efforts to kick it into the long grass. The only way the prime minister will be able to avoid defeat will be to offer significant concessions.

The Global Future research is based on the government’s own impact studies on three different Brexit scenarios, but also examines a fourth option – a bespoke deal – using data from the official assessments along with details set out by the prime minister in her Mansion House speech.



It suggested that option would increase the cost of non-tariff barriers by £23bn over the status quo. Other costs – including customs barriers, divorce payments and ongoing contributions – would add another £38bn while limits on free movement would dent the economy by £6bn.

However, the analysis found that a bespoke deal could also bring in £27bn extra to the Treasury, including from customs revenue and EU budget savings. Overall, the net cost of the deal would be £40bn a year by 2033-34, or £615m a week in today’s prices.

After looking at all four options available to the prime minister, the study established that in the long-term, the amount of money available for spending on public services would fall. Under the so-called Norway option, there would be £262m less a week, under the Canada model it would be £877m, while under a no deal it would be £1.25bn.

This would mean 22% less funding available for the NHS if there was a bespoke deal, and 9%, 31% and 44% less under each of the other options.

A poll of 2,000 people for Global Future found they overwhelmingly thought all four possible deals – bespoke, remaining in the European Economic Area, a free trade agreement and crashing out onto World Trade Organization terms – were bad.

It also found that 72% of those who voted leave thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for the bespoke deal; while 78% felt it was worse than they had hoped for when casting their vote in the EU referendum.

When forced to choose between the four scenarios described, more than half of all those polled – 51%– opted for the Norway-style deal, which has the least impact on public finances and trade, as well as the fewest additional controls of immigration. Leave voters also narrowly preferred this option – 37% compared with 36% who backed a bespoke deal.

Portes said: “If we are to decide what sort of Brexit we want, the least we need is a menu, with prices. The one we have prepared represents the government’s current best estimates. It’s up to us to decide which of these prices is worth paying.”","study for thinktank Global Future found a bespoke deal would have a net negative fiscal impact of about £40bn a year. polling commissioned for study by populus found that voters, even those who backed Brexit, feared that leaving the european union would come at 'too high a price' analysis came as the government braced itself for defeats in parliament."

The number of UK businesses exporting goods to the EU fell 33 per cent to 18,357 in 2021, from 27,321 in 2020.

Michelle Dale, a senior manager at accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, pointed out the fall is due to the extra red tape UK businesses must now comply with when exporting to the EU.

“Businesses are not getting enough support from the Government to navigate the post-Brexit trading minefield,” she said, reports City A.M.

“A lot of SMEs can’t afford professional advice to cope with Brexit-related red tape. Many are likely to have decided trading with the EU is not worth the cost,” Dale added.

“Fewer UK companies exporting to the EU will result in lost opportunities for growth and expansion in Europe.”

EU receives UK’s response to legal threats

Meanwhile, the European Union is considering its next steps after receiving the UK’s response to legal threats over the failure to comply with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol.

Despite politics as normal being paused while the nation mourns the Queen’s death, the Government responded to the action ahead of Thursday’s deadline.

The bloc had requested a response to its raft of infringement proceedings over the UK’s failure to comply with the rules before the end of the day.

European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said: “I can confirm we have received a reply from the UK. We will now analyse the reply before deciding on the next steps.”

What the UK’s response contained was unclear, but the Government was expected to set out how it believes that no operational changes on how the protocol works are required.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be in Westminster for the Queen’s funeral on Monday.

It is unclear if she will be meeting Prime Minister Liz Truss while in London, although Ms Truss is expected to hold some talks with political leaders during their visits.

There have been unconfirmed suggestions that Ms Truss will speak to Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin on the margins of the funeral amid tensions over the protocol.

She also claims some Brexiters are consumed with hatred for Germany and gripped by a myth that they liberated Europe on their own, describing Brexit as a triumph of emotion over reason, won by a campaign full of lies in which negative attitudes to migration were exploited by figures such as Johnson and Michael Gove.

Bermann, who served as the French ambassador to the UK from 2014 to 2017 and has been one of the most senior diplomats in the French diplomatic service, including as ambassador to China and to Russia, assesses the British handling of the Covid pandemic as among the worst in the world alongside that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. She predicts Johnson will seek to use Covid to mask the true economic cost of Brexit on the UK economy.

Johnson, she says, comes from an Eton and Oxford University class that believes they are entitled to use language to provoke. Describing him as intelligent and charming, she says he uses “lies to embellish reality, as a game and as instrument of power. The ends justify the means. He has no rules.”

Asked at a Royal United Services Institute thinktank event about her description of him as an unrepentant liar, she said: “He would not object to being called that. He knows he is a liar. He has always played with that. He was fired from his first post for that reason.”

In her book, Goodbye Britannia, she seeks to define the psyche that led to Brexit. She describes “the partisans of Brexit as reciting a history in which the UK is never defeated, never invaded”. She suggests a country that considers it singlehandedly won the second world war, liberating the continent and deserving of gratitude.

Referencing the more than 22 million Russians who died in the war, she says “this does not disturb the discourse of the Brexiters who peddle the myth that the UK liberated Europe alone and needs no one”.

She adds that France does have a debt of gratitude to the British, but “it is right to remember that they were not alone and you cannot live with a history that stopped in June 1944”.

“The corollary of an England saving Europe,” she adds, “is a detestation of Germany and contempt for cowardice – the term is often used for those who allowed themselves to be occupied, not to mention collaborated.”

The British account of the second world war, relayed in films such as Dunkirk, she says, led to loss of confidence in the EU as an instrument of peace.

She admits she did not believe the Brexit referendum would be lost by David Cameron’s government, pointing out that both sides of the debate had told her the same. In retrospect, she viewed the defeat as the first crisis of electoral democracy, and the harbinger of the populism that has been followed through in the US and Europe.

“David Cameron was always telling other heads of government that he would win and he rejected any help from EU countries,” she told Rusi. She said that if Cameron had warned the EU that he was going to lose, Europe would have come up with a new offer on migration. British ministers told her that they might win with as much as 60% of the vote.

In the book, she asks: “How this country whose influence had been decisive in Brussels, which insolently rolled out the red carpet for French entrepreneurs and which Xi Jinping had elected in October 2015 as the gateway to Europe, at the dawn of a golden period, how has it undertaken to scuttle itself?”

She predicts: “Boris Johnson’s temptation will be to hide the bill for Brexit under the Covid carpet, valued at more than £200bn for 2020, almost as much as the United Kingdom’s total contribution to the European Union since its accession in 1973, which was £215bn.”

She says it is inevitable that the UK will struggle now to find influence outside the EU, and has a Scottish independence referendum hanging over its head.

She says she believes the EU would feel obliged to open talks with Scotland in the event of a referendum vote to leave the UK, but that is not the official EU position, partly due to pressure from Spain. Madrid fears the knock-on impact among Catalan separatists if an independent Scotland was allowed to join the EU.","former french ambassador to the UK says Boris Johnson is ""an unrepentant liar"" she claims some Brexiters are gripped by myth that they liberated Europe on their own. in her book, goodbye Britannia, she describes the partisans of Brexit as reciting a history."

The former Pulp frontman spoke to filmmaker Jeanie Finlay for The Quietus, in which she asked him what he made of being referred to as an “unconventional national treasure.”

“Obviously it’s meant as a compliment,” he said, “but sometimes… well especially when people said it in the last couple of years… I’m talking about Brexit basically.”

“Because I was very vocally against that and still think it’s one of the most pathetic things ever, especially now. There’s freedom of movement in Europe and it’s so sad that we’ve chucked that away. I’m a little bit bothered about people knowing that I’m English because it’s a bit embarrassing at the moment because of this psychotic thing we’re doing. So I don’t know. It’s something that I can’t really have a perspective on.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Cocker said he had attended Black Lives Matter protests in Paris. “All this stuff about these statues getting chucked in the water and stuff like that, well fair enough,” he said.

“Historically speaking you’ve got to realise that things don’t change on their own, people have to protest and, for want of a better phrase, make a nuisance of themselves in order for stuff to change, because otherwise the people who’ve created that situation will just carry on doing it.”

Cocker is currently preparing to release his first album under the name JARV IS…, to be titled ‘Beyond The Pale’ and released via Rough Trade on July 17.

The south west and south coast of England were the worst affected, according to data gathered by environmental campaign group Surfers Against Sewage (SAS).

Swimmers are advised against bathing at seven beaches in Cornwall as a result of storm sewage overflows, with four in Devon and five in Dorset also polluted by the recent downpours.

Nine beaches in Sussex, three on the Isle of Wight and three in Essex were also hit by storm sewage.

Elsewhere, there were warnings in place at spots in Lincolnshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and South Wales, as well as two inland wild swimming spots near Bristol and near Minehead in Somerset.

On Tuesday, there was an alert at Spittal near Berwick in Northumberland, although this has since cleared.

There has been growing public outrage in recent years at the volume of raw or partially-treated sewage pumped into the UK’s rivers and coastal waters.

Hugo Tagholm, the chief executive of SAS, tweeted on Tuesday: “The shitstorm after the calm. Many south coast beaches off limits due to @SouthernWater sewage discharges.”

A speech made by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of the referendum in June 2016 has also been making the rounds on social media.

Speaking about the positive impact the UK’s membership of the European Union has had, the former Labour leader said:

“It was EU regulation that improved the UK’s beaches which, if you go back 30 or 40 years, were in a terrible state.

“Britain used to pump our untreated sewage straight into the sea. Just 25 years ago one in four British beaches were too dirty to swim in. Now 95 per cent of our beaches have a clean bill of health.”

The EU has shot down Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan within moments of his appointment as Tory leader, in the latest sign that the bloc has no plans to make concessions.

In an intervention timed to coincide with Mr Johnson’s election announcement, Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice president, told reporters in Brussels that the EU would not renegotiate the deal reached with Theresa May.

Another EU commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, also warned that politicians like Mr Johnson were undermining democracy with “cheap promises, simplified visions, blatantly evident incorrect statements”.

Mr Timmermans said: “He [Boris Johnson] took a long time deciding whether he was for or against Brexit and now his position is clear.

“I think the position of the EU is also clear: the United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union and the European Union will stick with that agreement. We will hear what the new prime minister has to say when he comes to Brussels.”

The bloc has said since last year it would not re-open talks on the withdrawal agreement struck by Ms May, which was rejected by MPs three times.

Mr Johnson has said he would try to use the withholding of payments owed to the EU as leverage to force it back to the negotiating table.

Mr Timmermans had previously suggested that Mr Johnson might not be sincere in his support for leaving the European Union, and could be “playing games”.

Asked about the comments on Tuesday, he said: “I would just suggest that you look at what he’s been writing over the years.

“I don’t think I’m telling any secrets when I say that Boris Johnson took a long time to decide which side of the argument he was on. He did that publicly and in letters he’s written.”

Mr Timmermans, who is expected to stay in post after October and provide continuity between the current EU Commission and the next, added that the commission had “negotiated in good faith”, telling reporters: “I think if you have an agreement between a country and an organisation like the EU it’s the responsibility of all to stick to that agreement and make it work.”

He also suggested there was no mandate for a no-deal Brexit, adding: “I think if we look back at the last years I don’t think there were many people in the UK who, when they voted for Brexit, that intentionally voted for a no-deal Brexit. I don’t think that happened.”

In a separate blog post published on Tuesday, Mr Andriukaitis, Lithuania’s EU commissioner, also took aim at Mr Johnson and his “cheap promises”.

He wrote: “A functioning democracy demands discussion of us. Using WHATEVER means to win political battles just does not fit the bill. Boris Johnson ‘virtuoso’ in democracy is the example of this in action – where priority is given to the objective alone and not the means of obtaining it.

“On this shaky path almost anything is allowed: cheap promises, simplified visions, blatantly evident incorrect statements on ‘EU imposed’ food safety standards. Can democracy survive this type of politics? My take is that democracy chooses only those principles that derive from it, defend it and legitimize it. The ones that stem from ‘fake’ facts are killing it.

“Almost ironically, without comparing the UK itself with the USSR because it is not comparable, I can’t think of a better golden standard than the USSR in terms of fact distortion, reality falsification and blunt oblivions of reality.”

Boris Johnson begins by thanking Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May as he is announced as new Conservative Party leader

Mr Andriukatis added: “I can only wish him luck in ‘taking back control’, spending more money on the NHS, swiftly concluding new trade agreements.”

The commissioner also revealed that Jeremy Hunt, Mr Johnson’s opponent in the Tory leadership battle, had never responded to an invitation to discuss the differences between the EU and USSR. Mr Hunt had previously compared the two states, causing outrage in eastern Europe and elsewhere.

“Having spent some time of my life in the Soviet exile, I couldn’t help but offer to discuss the differences with him. Unfortunately, Jeremy Hunt did not reply to my call for lack of interest or otherwise,” he wrote.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier struck a more businesslike tone in welcoming Mr Johnson to office, however.

“We look forward to working constructively with prime minister Boris Johnson when he takes office, to facilitate the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and achieve an orderly Brexit,” he said.

“We are ready also to rework the agreed declaration on a new partnership in line with European Council guidelines.”

Incoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated Mr Johnson.

Brexit has ceased to be the “will of the people” and in a second referendum 55 per cent would vote Remain, analysis of British Social Attitudes Survey respondents has suggested.

The new National Centre for Social Research data also found that just six per cent now think the UK will secure a good Brexit deal - a massive reduction from the 33 per cent who were optimistic about the outcome of negotiations when the Article 50 process was triggered in March 2017.

The findings have led the centre’s senior research fellow Sir John Curtice to warn MPs discussing Brexit in Parliament: “There is seemingly room for debate about whether leaving the EU is still the ‘will’ of a majority of voters in the UK.

“Perhaps the key message for the politicians as they decide what to do is that those on all sides of the argument might be best advised to show a degree of humility when claiming to know what voters really want.”

The centre’s analysis was based on interviews conducted between 24 January and 17 February with 2,654 adults who had previously participated in the British Social Attitudes Survey.

It found that only 79 per cent of those who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum said they would vote for Brexit again. The analysis found that nearly two-thirds of ex-Leave supporters now thought Brexit would be bad for the British economy.

The researchers also found that another factor in the apparent swing to Remain was the tendency of those who didn’t vote in the 2016 referendum to say they would now vote to stay in the EU. Fully 56 per cent of the previous non-participants said they would now vote Remain, compared with only 19 per cent who now backed Leave.

When researchers extrapolated from the survey data to see what the outcome would be if the electorate were again asked the 2016 EU referendum question - ‘Should the UK remain a member of the EU or leave the EU?’ – they found a hypothetical 55 per cent majority for Remain.

This would suggest the 52-48 Leave vote registered in the 2016 EU referendum had now become a 55-45 majority in favour of Remain.

Online petition urging Government to cancel Brexit becomes most popular to be submitted with more than 4,150,000 signatures

Sir John issued a note of caution by saying: “The Remain lead in our data is not sufficiently large for anyone to be sure what the outcome of any second ballot would be, especially as any such ballot would occur after a campaign that might result in a shift of opinion in one direction or the other.”

Given the importance to the new apparent Remain majority of people who did not vote in 2016, Sir John also warned: “There must be a question mark about whether those who did not vote first time around would necessarily do so second time around.""

But he concluded the new data clearly showed a “potential frailty of arguments that leaving the EU is necessarily the ‘will’ of a majority of the British public.

“It is enough to raise doubts about whether, two and half years after the original ballot, leaving the EU necessarily continues to represent the view of a majority of the British public.",just six per cent now think the UK will secure a good Brexit deal. this is a massive reduction from 33 per cent who were optimistic about the outcome of negotiations when the Article 50 process was triggered in March 2017.

Why are its critics in cabinet so silent? | Michael Heseltine,"After a lifetime close to the workings of government, I approach drafting an article about Brexit for a Sunday publication with trepidation. Both sides have said a decision will be taken today, but not what that may be; and anyway, can you believe that any decision will really be the last?

What I do know is that both sides will be presenting the story that best serves their negotiating positions and pleases their most important audiences. Facts are in short supply; there is a plethora of spin.

“Taking back control” will summon up the blood of British patriotism. The union jack prominently displayed before the negotiating table reinforces the demand for sovereignty, while a few asides about cheating foreigners reinforce national prejudices. The leadership necessary to listen to the other side, and understand where compromises may lead, all too soon becomes a cult of nationalism led by the most extreme of partisan groupings.

“I will have my cake and eat it” is rather a good joke on this side of the Channel. It has a quite different implication for the rest of Europe where sovereignty matters as well – theirs, not ours.

I don’t know exactly where all this posturing will end up by January; but I do know that – deal or no deal – we will in theory and in practice be outside the European Union. That is the policy on which the government was elected; they have a mandate and I would not vote against their legislation. I believe that it will be seen as a Tory measure and I will have nothing to do with it. This government will be – and should be – held responsible for quite simply the worst peacetime decision of modern times. I know of members of the cabinet who believe this as firmly as I do. I cannot understand their silence.

So we are where we are. Christmas is upon us and before the country goes back to work we are on our own. Sovereign, in charge, control regained. None of that creates a single job, one pound’s worth of investment or any rise in living standards. We will have risked our trading relationship with the world’s largest market on our doorstep, which accounts for nearly half our imports and exports.

Yet we are constantly told of a glorious tomorrow. All that is missing is a shred of evidence or a single fact.

We are constantly told of a glorious tomorrow. All that is missing is a shred of evidence

The illusion that Donald Trump would do some favourable deal evaporated with Donald Trump. We have rolled over 20 existing European deals on the same terms in the future as we have now. No gain there. What happens when, say, Country A renegotiates its deal with the EU? Silence. Are we to believe that we will be able to continue to export to Country A products that will then be of a lower standard than they will have agreed with the EU? How long would arguments about British sovereignty or control hold out against the united refusal of Country A and the EU to let us continue trading on the terms previously agreed?

A no-deal Brexit would relegate us to World Trade Organization terms. (Forgive me if I don’t follow the attempt to confuse my affection and admiration for Australia to adopt the latest propaganda technique of renaming WTO as Australian.) These mean that any tariffs offered to one country must be offered to all. Sovereignty over the rules will simply transfer from Brussels to the WTO head office in Geneva.

A little more light has now been shed on a future support system for agriculture after Brexit. The old system has always been controversial here. After the war, French governments were anxious to avoid the flood of people from large parts of rural France into urban areas. Anyone familiar with southern France can understand the challenges of maintaining viable economic lifestyles. A deal was struck with Germany to underpin the countryside with subsidies, in exchange for access for manufactured goods. It was not a good system and has now been significantly reformed, but we accepted it in 1973 as a condition of EEC membership. Its main characteristic was a per-acre subsidy which is now to be replaced by a more grant-based system. Grant-based systems need forms, inspection and contributions to cost. Large farms such as my family company will adjust, although almost certainly prices will rise. However, tenant farmers will be particularly hard hit, especially those without capital to invest in land they don’t own, and in areas of marginal viability.

The fishing controversy is a particularly emotive one on both sides of the Channel. Memories of the cod wars reinforce the consequences of effective control, particularly when the Royal Navy has only a fraction of the number of ships deployed at that time. But how little do we hear of the licences issued to British fishing fleet-owners, when we joined the common fisheries policy, who promptly sold their licences to the Europeans who could then fish in our waters. A large proportion of fish caught by British trawlers is landed directly in France and sold on within the EU. Is it not a racing certainty that, with no deal, the French fishermen will block their ports to entry by British trawlers to stop this happening? The Royal Navy has been put on standby to board French trawlers. The European community was born to prevent such incidents precipitating the continent into yet greater violence

Of course Britain must use every endeavour to take advantage of the relative high growth rates of the Asian markets. Success will depend on having something someone wants to buy at prices someone will pay.

There are virtually no British-owned volume car companies. An exception is Ineos, whose owner, Sir Jim Radcliffe, last week overcame his enthusiasm for Brexit by deciding to locate production of his Grenadier 4x4 in France. The Americans are located here historically, while the Japanese came to secure a foothold in the European market. If they have significant ambitions to sell in Asia they will manufacture in Asia, taking advantage of lower labour and transit costs, and proximity of supply lines.

This will apply to much of manufacturing. We have great strengths in the service industries but there are few exceptions to the rule that to gain access to a market you need local managers and employees. To really succeed in these markets you need to be there, not thousands of miles away with different languages and culture.

My most serious criticism of the government is that it has done so little to understand the real nature of the challenges we face or to prepare our country to meet them. No one can blame the government for the Covid crisis, which, in any case, may be at last seriously diminished by the vaccine. But Covid has acted as a curtain behind which, unseen, Brexit has crept closer.

The government has greeted this crisis in the traditional Whitehall-knows-best way, underpinned by vast quantities of borrowing money. What is missing is any attempt to recognise the disparate nature of our local city economies. They are all different, with different strengths and weaknesses, requirements and, above all, effective local leadership.

Yet the elected mayors in these vital parts of our economy have had no call to arms. Ministers borrow the money and define how it should be spent along lines that reflect the structure of Whitehall. No other similar economy so centralises its decision-making. We need to enthuse communities and build on the partnerships between public and private sectors that exist there.

My hope is that, by the time you read this, common sense will have prevailed and both sides will have drawn back from the abyss. But if the prime minister has been forced to remain inflexible by hardliners at his shoulder, then he will have failed his test of leadership. We will pay the price.","both sides have said a decision will be taken today, but not what that may be. “taking back control” will summon up the blood of British patriotism. “i will have my cake and eat it” is rather a good joke on this side of the channel."

Editorial update (October 17th 2019): This piece has been changed to include news of the announcement of a Brexit deal

AS WE WENT to press on October 17th Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, announced that a Brexit deal had been reached. Any agreement made in Brussels would still have to be approved by Britain’s cantankerous House of Commons, which threw out the deal that was struck late last year and may scupper any future one, too. Nonetheless, the new—and welcome—willingness of both sides to compromise suggests that, whatever happens in the next few days, the odds of a chaotic no-deal exit have lengthened considerably.

That is a relief for all parties, and particularly Britain, which stood to suffer the most from crashing out. Yet it is hardly time to celebrate. The outlines of a draft deal that were being circulated as the European summit began were pretty grim for Britain. Excitement at the prospect of at last “getting Brexit done”, as Mr Johnson puts it, should not obscure the fact that his proposed deal would be bad for the economy, bad for the union, and bear little relation to what voters narrowly backed in a referendum more than three years ago.

The deal that seems to be taking shape is economically worse for Britain than the one negotiated by Theresa May last year. It would remove the unpopular “Irish backstop” arrangement by taking Britain out of the EU’s customs union altogether, and scrapping a promise to maintain regulatory alignment with the bloc. That would erect barriers to trade with what is by far Britain’s biggest partner. Unless things were to change dramatically during the short transition period, within ten years Mr Johnson’s deal would have reduced Britain’s total trade by about 13%, making people roughly 6%, or £2,000 ($2,560) a year, poorer than they would otherwise have been, one estimate finds. That is almost a third more than the hit that would have been delivered by Mrs May’s deal.

Mr Johnson’s deal would also, in effect, establish a customs border between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. Not only would this make life harder for businesses in the region, one of the poorest in the United Kingdom. It would also risk inflaming sectarian tensions, just as a border between north and south would have done. The Good Friday peace agreement of 1998 rested on the idea that the Northern Irish could feel equally part of Britain or Ireland, or both. Building a customs barrier in the Irish Sea would rattle that agreement.

Nor is that the only part of the union that is coming loose. Since the Brexit referendum, support for independence has been growing in Scotland, where polls now put it at 50% and rising. The ruling Scottish National Party believes that a second independence referendum will be given the green light within two years (see article). An earlier one, in 2014, was an uncomfortably close-run thing. Brexit, which Scots voted strongly against, could well tip the next vote the other way. Meanwhile, even in Wales, long the most contented member of the union, independence has crept back on the agenda. One recent poll found that 40% of the Welsh would gladly leave Britain, if it means they could stay in the EU after Brexit.

It may be that English voters are itching so badly to break free of Europe that they see all this as a reasonable price. Three years of wretched talks have made everyone keen to get the whole thing over with. Perhaps a majority are willing to forgo a couple of thousand pounds a year, and a nation or two. But there is a grave risk that voters are no longer up for this. Mr Johnson’s proposed deal carries a much heavier economic and constitutional cost than any plan advertised when they were asked for their opinion back in 2016. Most polls suggest a majority have since cooled on the idea of Brexit and, given the choice, would now vote to remain. It is good news that a deal has been struck. But it would be no triumph of democracy if it were pushed through without first being put to a confirmatory popular vote.",the odds of a chaotic no-deal exit have lengthened considerably. the outlines of a draft deal were being circulated as the european summit began. the deal that seems to be taking shape is economically worse for Britain than the one negotiated by theresa may last year.

Victoria Prentis faced calls for her to quit after the comments, but the prime minister is standing by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) minister.

Asked if her jaw had dropped when she saw the deal with the EU on Christmas Eve, Prentis told the Lords EU environment subcommittee: “No, the agreement came when we were all very busy on Christmas Eve, in my case organising the local nativity trail.

“We had been waiting and waiting, it looked like it was coming for probably four days before it actually arrived.

“I, for one, had gone through, as I’m sure members of this committee had, a gamut of emotions over those four days.”

A No 10 spokesperson told the PA news agency that the prime minister had confidence in Prentis, 49.

But the Scottish National party took a dim view of the behaviour of Prentis, the MP for Banbury and North Oxfordshire, and insisted that she should stand down.

The comments came following delays to seafood exports after the Brexit transition period ended on New Year’s Eve.

Companies trying to export fish and other Scottish seafood have encountered red tape since the new trading rules with the EU came into force.

The SNP’s Brexit spokesperson, Philippa Whitford, said: “Due to Brexit-induced bureaucracy, Scotland’s fishing communities are already experiencing severe disruption and cannot get their produce to their customers in the EU market on time.

“For the Tory government’s fisheries minister to then admit that she did not even bother to read the details of the damaging deal because she was too busy is unbelievable and makes her position untenable.”","fisheries minister Victoria Prentis faced calls for her to quit after the comments. but the pm is standing by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra)"

The Conservative veteran, 85, will address a rally calling for a second referendum ahead of Tuesday’s crunch Commons vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.

He will claim that the government appears to have “lost control” and there were signs that MPs were prepared to take action to “assert the authority” of parliament.

Highlighting a generational split in the result of the 2016 referendum, he will say “those of a certain age who voted 70:30 to leave” are “rapidly being replaced by a younger generation who voted 70:30 to stay”.

At the rally in London’s ExCel centre, which will also be addressed by politicians including Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Tory former ministers Anna Soubry and Philip Lee, and celebrities including Charles Dance and Jason Isaacs, Heseltine will claim that those campaigning for a second vote are “British patriots” who are “proud of our Commonwealth and empire”.

The event, organised by the Best for Britain and People’s Vote campaigns, will feature politicians from the Tories, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green party and Plaid Cymru.

Heseltine will hit out at Brexiters who have called pro-EU politicians “traitors”, saying: “May our opponents never be forgiven for their allegations that it is us who are letting Britain down.”

He will say: “Let us make our position clear. We are the British patriots. We want a Britain at the heart of Europe because we want the voice of Britain, the tolerance of Britain, the culture of Britain, at the heart of Europe. We are proud of our Commonwealth and empire. Our voice is their voice in Europe.

“It is the Brexiteers who seek to belittle us, to undermine our influence, to slam windows, to close doors with the suggestion that our membership of the European community blunts our influence.”

In comments echoing a youthful William Hague’s address to the Tory conference in 1977, when he told his ageing audience “half of you won’t be here in 30 or 40 years’ time” as he discussed the future, Lord Heseltine will say: “Let me repeat his warning. Let me paraphrase his words. ‘I certainly won’t be here.’ But neither will my generation.

“The parents, the grandparent will have gone. The younger generation, they will be here. They will be here.

“They will never forgive us if we now exclude them from the corridors of European power. Offered a seat in an anteroom as others decide behind closed doors. Invited to submit their views in writing so others may decide behind closed doors.

“Trying to negotiate trade deals on behalf of the United Kingdom in competition with a European Union six times our size offering bigger, better deals behind closed doors.”

Heseltine will add: “No one can predict the events of next week. Every news bulletin, every headline, every leak tells us of a government that has lost control. These are the first promising signs that a growing number of members of the House of Commons are prepared to assert the authority and sovereignty of that place.

“Our country’s future depends on their judgment and will. They must act in the national interest. Their conclusions must be put back to the people for their endorsement.”

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has said in an article for the Sunday Telegraph that he could launch a new political party and fight the 2019 European election if Brexit is delayed.

Just days after quitting Ukip, the party he led to victory in the 2014 European elections, Farage said he was “thinking about vehicles” to contest the elections next year if the UK is still in the European Union.

“I am not going to lie down and watch it go down the plug hole. I couldn’t do that. And I won’t do that.”

Theresa May has bowed to EU pressure to keep the UK in the European Convention on Human Rights, in another move that will inflame the Tory right.

The Brexit white paper pledges that the government is “committed” to staying in the treaty – after Brussels said pulling out would jeopardise a future security deal.

The prime minister has previously backed leaving the ECHR, although she acknowledged there was no Commons majority for doing so at present.

In her 2016 Conservative leadership campaign, Ms May said she believed ECHR membership made it harder to deport terror suspects and criminals.

She became an opponent during her spell as Home Secretary during her attempts - which eventually took eight years - to extradite hate preacher Abu Qatada to Jordan to face terrorism charges.

On the eve of the Brexit referendum, Ms May said: “The ECHR can bind the hands of parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals – and does nothing to change the attitudes of governments like Russia’s when it comes to human rights.”

Last year’s Tory election manifesto pledged staying in only “for the duration of the next parliament”, until the Brexit process had been completed.

Crucially, if the UK does agree a post-Brexit deal with the EU which includes a guarantee to remain part of the ECHR, it would effectively lock the UK in permanently.

PA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK’s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreement (with the EU) Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreements (internationally) The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM.

Bernard Jenkin, a prominent Brexiteer, told The Independent: “If we remain in the ECHR we will continue to have problems expelling foreign terrorist suspects, and be obliged to treat them as asylum seekers if they insist when they arrive.

“So it is a further loss of control over our borders. There is no reason that parliament should not oversee the UK’s human rights, rather than a foreign-dominated court.”

Ms May had also insisted a future security treaty between the UK and the EU to fight crime and terrorism should be “unconditional”, urging Brussels not to put the security of the entire continent at risk.

But, last December, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator insisted Europe-wide security co-operation was dependent on the UK not dropping out of the ECHR.

Any agreement would be subject to a “guillotine clause” with the aim of keeping the UK tied to the agreement - even though it is not governed by the EU.

The prime minister’s spokeswoman did not dispute that the government had shifted its position, saying: “The entire document is an evolution of our position.

“There are lots of announcements and news and sections in there [the white paper] that are different to what we've said before.

“There is much that is new and it is based on our view that we put forward a credible offer that we can now move forward with in time for October.”

The ECHR was drafted as long ago as 1950, by the newly-formed Council of Europe, and was written into British law, under the Blair government, by the 1998 Human Rights Act.

Tory Eurosceptics have criticised the treaty, arguing it gives judges in Strasbourg the ability to rule in Britain on issues such as a right to privacy and family life.

But pro-EU Conservatives, such as Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, have warned that walking out would encourage other European countries to abuse human rights – and lower international respect for the UK.",theresa may has bowed to EU pressure to keep the UK in the ECHR. the prime minister has previously backed leaving the treaty. but she acknowledged there was no majority for doing so at present.
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/m3dcxd/exports_to_eu_plunge_by_56bn_in_first_month_since/,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/12/exports-to-eu-plunge-in-first-month-since-brexit-uk-economy?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,Exports to EU plunge by 40% in first month since Brexit,"UK exports of goods to the EU plunged by 40.7% in January as the first month since Brexit and the imposition of a new Covid lockdown resulted in the biggest monthly decline in British trade for more than 20 years.

In the first month since leaving the EU on terms agreed by Boris Johnson’s government, the Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the bloc fell by £5.6bn, while imports fell by 28.8%, or £6.6bn.

Exports of food and live animals to the EU were the hardest hit by Brexit, collapsing by 63.6% in January. Consignments of fish and shellfish collapsed by 83% from the level a year ago to only £16m.

This reflected heavier disruption and additional checks for consignments from this sector that prompted furious protests from the fishing industry. However, food and live animals account for only 7% of total UK exports.

After stockpiling and disruption at UK borders in the run-up to the Brexit transition, the decline also came as the economy in January shrank by the largest amount since the first wave of the pandemic, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 2.9% from December, according to the ONS.

The ONS said the January performance was the worst since monthly records began in 1997, as a 1.7% rise in non-EU trade, worth £200m, failed to make up for the plunge in cross-border activity with the UK’s biggest trading partner. Overall, global UK exports and imports fell by about a fifth.

Although January’s GDP figure represents the biggest contraction since the first lockdown almost a year ago, analysts had forecast a bigger decline of 4.9%, suggesting that businesses and households adapted better to harsh restrictions than during the first wave of the pandemic, when GDP fell by more than 20% in April 2020.

Experts said the scale of the decline in January trade was unlikely to be permanent because there was evidence companies stockpiled goods before the Brexit deadline, meaning they would not need to send as many shipments as usual in January. The decline was lower than a 68% plunge reported by road hauliers, while the ONS said there were signs trade had started to pick up at the end of the month.

The closure of shops during the Covid-19 lockdown reduced demand for clothing shipments, car production fell and exports were weak to EU countries as tougher coronavirus restrictions were imposed across the continent.

Alongside stockpiling, Covid disruption and lockdown, the ONS also changed the way it collects export data after Brexit, which could mean it takes longer to record some UK goods shipped to the EU.

The prime minister’s former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said there was a “unique combination of factors” that meant it was “inevitable that we would see some unusual figures this January”.

Frost, who was elevated last month to become the cabinet minister responsible for Britain’s relationship with the EU, said these effects were now “starting to unwind” and that overall freight volumes had been “back to their normal levels for over a month now”.

However, one economist said Brexit played a decisive role in January and would continue to weigh on growth. “Brexit made a bad situation worse,” said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Brexit is best seen as a slow puncture, rather than a sudden blowout, with the costs gradually accumulating in the form of lower investment and immigration than otherwise would have been the case.”

In a reflection of the Brexit impact, UK goods exports to Ireland fell 47% in January, the sharpest fall among main trading partners.

While the government has admitted to “teething problems” at the start of the new relationship, business leaders have warned that lengthier delivery times and higher costs are likely to remain as an endemic feature of Brexit.

Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021.”

It comes as the government was forced this week to delay the introduction of further post-Brexit import checks by six months – a U-turn because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time.

A government spokesman said the figures did not reflect the overall EU-UK trading relationship post Brexit.

Brexit has caused a six per cent increase in Britain’s food prices, according to new evidence showing the impact of the UK’s departure from the EU.

Economists found that greater trade barriers on imports from the bloc has had a “clear and robust” impact on food prices, as hard-pressed families struggle to cope with the cost of living crisis.

Grocery bills have risen most sharply for food products more reliant on imports from the EU, the study by the LSE Centre for Economic Performance revealed.

Products with high EU import shares such as fresh pork, tomatoes and jams were more affected than those with low EU import shares such as tuna and exotic fruits like pineapple.

Nikhil Datta, LSE researcher, said the findings showed “a clear and robust impact of Brexit-induced trade frictions increasing food prices for UK consumers during a time when the economy is already facing inflationary pressures from global sources”.

The academics’ analysis shows that Brexit increased average food prices by about six per cent over 2020 and 2021, with the very sharpest rise coming after the Brexit trade deal came into force at the start of last year.

Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed earlier this month that rising food costs had “nothing to do with Brexit” – blaming global inflation and the Ukraine crisis.

Professor Anand Menon, director at UK in a Changing Europe, said the latest research “illustrates all too clearly that Brexit has had, and will continue to have a significant impact on our trade with the EU and hence on our economy”.

Calling on ministers to acknowledge the impact of Brexit, Prof Menon added: “We would be better placed to react to this if our debate were more honest about Brexit costs and benefits.”

It comes as separate research by Kantar analytics found that Britons can expect to spend an additional £271 on their groceries this year. The price of groceries has increased at its fastest rate in 11 years, with food price inflation hitting 5.9 per cent in April.

A new YouGov survey published on Tuesday found that 85 per cent of Britons have been affected by increasing food prices, nine in 10 (89 per cent) people said they have been hit by higher energy prices.

Meanwhile, food bank managers have warned of the damage the crisis is doing among the poorest families, as both soaring bills and price hikes push a growing number of people into hardship.

New figures from the Trussell Trust network showed that food banks provided than 2.1 million parcels in the year until March – a 14 per cent increase since the period before the Covid pandemic.

Boris Johnson was criticised for holding a cabinet meeting in which he asked for “innovative” ideas to address the cost of living crisis which do not involve any new spending by chancellor Rishi Sunak.

Repeating his call for an emergency budget, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “The cost of living crisis has been staring us in the face for six months now.”

The latest findings on the impact of the Brexit follows LSE research showing that all extra red tape means the British firms has “stopped selling” many products to smaller EU countries.

The “major shock” of Brexit saw the number of relationships between buyers and sellers to fall by a third, with imports from the EU falling by 25 per cent relative to those from elsewhere.","Brexit has caused a six per cent increase in food prices in the uk. more trade barriers on imports from the bloc has had a ‘clear and robust’ impact on food prices. products with high EU import shares such as fresh pork, tomatoes and jams were more affected."

There will be border checks on trade inside the UK under the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson, the EU’s chief negotiator has said.

Michel Barnier confirmed there would be “checks and controls” between Britain and Northern Ireland under the agreement that will govern the UK’s exit from the EU.

Boris Johnson falsely claimed several times during the general election campaign that there would be no checks on the Irish sea, and was accused by the opposition of lying.

Whether the prime minister had misunderstood the agreement he had signed or was indeed lying to the public, the text of the deal signed in November is clear that there will indeed be checks.

“The implementation of this foresees checks and controls entering the island of Ireland,” Mr Barnier said during a sitting of the European Parliament.

“I look forward to constructive cooperation with British authorities to ensure that all provisions are respected and made operational.”

Mr Barnier had kept quiet during the UK general election campaign, telling anyone who asked him – even in private – that he did not want to say anything that could have political impact and undermine his Brexit deal.

Mr Johnson repeated his claim just on Monday, telling a press conference: “Be in no doubt. We are the government of the United Kingdom. I cannot see any circumstances whatever in which they will be any need for checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to GB.

“The only circumstances in which you could imagine the need for checks coming from GB to NI, as I’ve explained before, is if those goods were going on into Ireland and we had not secured, which I hope and I’m confident we will, a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement with our friends and partners in the EU.”

During the election campaign he was even more emphatic, saying: “We will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB.”

But his analysis does not accurately reflect what is in the Brexit deal he signed.

The government’s own internal analysis, leaked during the general election campaign, said there would be checks on goods in both directions between the two parts of the UK.

It also said there would be a devastating impact on the Northern Irish economy and claimed 98 per cent of Northern Ireland export businesses would be “likely to struggle to bear this cost” of customs declarations and documentary and physical checks on goods within the UK.","there will be border checks between the uk and northern ireland under the agreement that will govern the exit from the eu. the text of the deal signed in November is clear that there will indeed be checks. if there is a need for checks on goods going from GB to NI, there will be checks."

France will veto a further delay to Brexit unless the UK ends the chaos and tells the EU what it wants, the country’s foreign minister has warned.

“In the current circumstances, it’s ‘no’. We are not going to go through this every three months,” Jean-Yves Le Drian said.

The warning threatens the UK with a crash-out Brexit on 31 October – even if Boris Johnson accepts parliament’s order to seek another Article 50 extension.

“The [British] say that they want to put forward other solutions, alternative arrangements so that they can leave,” Mr Le Drian said, referring to the Irish backstop logjam.

“But we have not seen them and so it is ‘no’ – let the British authorities tell us the way forward.”

“Let them take responsibility for their situation, they have to tell us what they want.”

Emmanuel Macron has long been identified as the most hardline EU leader, in contrast to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who is willing to give the UK more time.

However, it had been assumed the French president would not “do a de Gaulle” – echoing his predecessor’s veto of the UK joining the then-EEC in the 1960s – if the UK held a general election, or Final Say referendum.

But an ally of Mr Macron warned last week that he feared there was not “a sufficient level of trust” about the UK’s intentions towards the EU.

Since then, No 10 has threatened to defy a law instructing it to seek an extension – and unveiled a plan to paralyse EU decision-making, to force it to bend to its will.

In her devastating resignation letter, Amber Rudd accused the prime minister of misleading the country over wanting to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

“I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government’s main objective,” the former work and pensions secretary wrote.

Today, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, invited ridicule, when he claimed the government had failed to put forward new proposals to secure a Brexit deal for fear the EU would leak them.

“What we are slightly reticent about doing, given past experience, is putting pieces of paper that will get leaked and rubbished by other side,” he said.

It is now clear that, regardless of the law to command a request to delay Brexit, the prime minister will not ask for it at the crucial EU summit on 17 October.

Instead, if no fresh deal is agreed, he will defy the order to ensure the controversy goes before the Supreme Court – with the Halloween deadline for crashing out just days away.","the warning threatens the UK with a crash-out Brexit on 31 October – even if Boris Johnson accepts parliament’s order to seek another Article 50 extension.

A triumph of dogged negotiation by May then, briefly, Johnson, has fulfilled the most pointless, masochistic ambition ever dreamed of in the history of these islands. The rest of the world, presidents Putin and Trump excepted, have watched on in astonishment and dismay. A majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. But those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. We must pack up our tents, perhaps to the sound of church bells, and hope to begin the 15-year trudge, back towards some semblance of where we were yesterday with our multiple trade deals, security, health and scientific co-operation and a thousand other useful arrangements.

The only certainty is that we’ll be asking ourselves questions for a very long time. Set aside for a moment Vote Leave’s lies, dodgy funding, Russian involvement or the toothless Electoral Commission. Consider instead the magic dust. How did a matter of such momentous constitutional, economic and cultural consequence come to be settled by a first-past-the-post vote and not by a super-majority? A parliamentary paper (see Briefing 07212) at the time of the 2015 Referendum Act hinted at the reason: because the referendum was merely advisory. It “enables the electorate to voice an opinion”. How did “advisory” morph into “binding”? By that blinding dust thrown in our eyes from right and left by populist hands.

We endured a numbing complicity between government and opposition. The door out of Europe was held open by Corbyn for Johnson to walk through. In this case, if you travelled far enough to the left, you met and embraced the right coming the other way.

What did we learn in our blindness? That those not flourishing within the status quo had no good reason to vote for it; that our prolonged parliamentary chaos derived from an ill-posed yes-no question to which there were a score of answers; that the long-evolved ecology of the EU has profoundly shaped the flora of our nation’s landscape and to rip these plants out will be brutal; that what was once called a hard Brexit became soft by contrast with the threatened no-deal that even now persists; that any mode of departure, by the government’s own estimate, will shrink the economy; that we have a gift for multiple and bitter division – young against old, cities against the country, graduates against early school-leavers, Scotland and Northern Ireland against England and Wales; that all past, present and future international trade deals or treaties are a compromise with sovereignty, as is our signature on the Paris accords, or our membership of Nato, and that therefore “Take Back Control” was the emptiest, most cynical promise of this sorry season.

We surprised ourselves. Only a few years ago, asked to list the nation’s ills – wealth gap, ailing NHS, north-south imbalance, crime, terrorism, austerity, housing crisis etc – most of us would not have thought to include our membership of the EU. How happy we were in 2012, in the afterglow of our successful Olympics. We weren’t thinking then of Brussels. It was, in Guy Verhofstadt’s famous term, a “cat-fight” within the Tory party that got us going. Those cats had been fighting each other for decades. When they dragged us in and urged us to take sides, we had a collective nervous breakdown; then sufficient numbers wanted the distress to go away and “get Brexit done”. Repeated ad nauseam by the prime minister it almost seemed impolite to ask why.

In the early days of the referendum campaign we learned that “on the doorstep” it was all about migration; but we also learned that it was the UK’s decision, not the EU’s, to allow unlimited migration from the accession countries before the permitted seven years were up; it was the UK’s choice to allow EU migrants to stay more than six months without a job; it was the UK that successfully campaigned to enlarge the EU eastwards; it is the UK, not the EU, that lets non-EU migration continue (and why not?) as EU migration declines. We also learned that the UK, not the EU, opted for our maroon rather than patriotic blue passports. Though, as I look, my old passports seem almost black.

There is much that is historically unjust about the British state, but very little of that injustice derives from the EU. Brussels didn’t insist that we neglect the post-industrial towns of the Midlands and the north; or demand that we let wages stagnate, or permit multimillion handouts to the CEOs of failing companies, or prefer shareholder value over the social good, or run our health service, social care and Sure Start into the ground, close 600 police stations and let the fabric of our state schools decay.

It was the task of the Brexit campaign to persuade the electorate otherwise. In the referendum they succeeded with 37%, enough to transform our collective fate for a generation at least. To cause sufficient numbers to believe that the source of all their grievances is some hostile outside element is the oldest trick in the populist handbook. As Trotsky was for Stalin, as the USA is for the mullahs of Iran and Gülen is for Erdoğan, so Brussels has served its turn.

Hedge fund owners, plutocrat donors to the cause, Etonians and newspaper proprietors cast themselves as enemies of the elite. More magic dust. The claim that the Northern Ireland issue has been settled is a dangerous pretence. We have witnessed reasoned argument’s fall from grace. The Brexit impulse had strong elements of blood-and-soil, with hints of Empire nostalgia. Such spooky longings floated high above mere facts.

We acquired an argot. “Article 50”, “frictionless trade”, “just in time”, “the backstop” – how they tripped off the tongue. We learned to respect an “invisible border”. Before it all began, only a very few knew the difference between the customs union and the single market. Three years on, not much has changed. A survey last year showed that quite a lot of us thought that “crashing out” was the same as remaining. If only.

The Brexit leadership and the leader of the opposition were always in a hurry to start article 50’s two-year stopwatch. They feared that leave voters might change their minds, that those who didn’t vote last time were 2:1 for remaining, and that young voters coming on to the rolls would be mostly pro-EU. The Brexiter generals reasonably feared a second referendum.

At least, we can all agree that we will be a bit poorer. As one of my school teachers used to say, if a thing is really worth doing, it’s worth doing badly. Theresa May could never bring herself to say that Brexit would make us better off. She wouldn’t even tell us if she would vote to leave in a second referendum. We should credit her honesty. By contrast, Boris Johnson, laying his post-Brexit vision before parliament, promised he would narrow the UK’s wealth and opportunity gap between north and south, and make it the home of cutting-edge battery technology. He forgot to mention that the EU never stood in the way of either project.

Redefining our new trade relations with the EU will preoccupy us for years. As for the US position, take a long walk in the American midwest and you’ll go a month across a monoculture desert and not see a wildflower. To compete, our own agriculture would have to welcome the hormone hypodermic. Our farmers will need to divest of inefficient hedgerows, boundary trees and three-metre field margins – museum pieces all. When it was in trade talks with the EU, the US wouldn’t contemplate higher standards of husbandry, food standards and environmental protection, even though they would have granted access to half a billion consumers. American farming corporations will not be changing their ways for a nation of a mere 65 million. If we want a deal, it is we who must downgrade.

We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed “strongmen”, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency. The lesson of our nation’s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn.

Take a road trip from Greece to Sweden, from Portugal to Hungary. Leave your passport behind. What a rich, teeming bundle of civilisations – in food, manners, architecture, language, and each nation state profoundly and proudly different from its neighbours. No evidence of being under the boot-heel of Brussels. Nothing here of continental USA’s dreary commercial sameness. Summon everything you’ve learned of the ruinous, desperate state of Europe in 1945, then contemplate a stupendous economic, political and cultural achievement: peace, open borders, relative prosperity, and the encouragement of individual rights, tolerance and freedom of expression. Until Friday this was where our grown-up children went at will to live and work.

That’s over, and for now the force is with English nationalism. Its champion is Johnson’s Vote Leave cabinet whose monument will forever be a special kind of smirk, perfected back in the days of the old Soviet Union. I’m lying, you know I’m lying and I know that you know and I don’t give a damn. As in, “The five-week prorogation of parliament has nothing to do with Brexit.” Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg were masters of the mocking grin. The supreme court’s inconvenient judgment that this prorogation was illegal clearly still rankles. Recently, the ex-home secretary Michael Howard was set on to murmur against the judges. Extending political control over an independent judiciary would be consonant with the Johnson-Cummings project. Victor Orbán of Hungary lights the way.

The remainers held out for a kinder sort of world, but we were always the herbivores in this debate, with our enormous, good-natured and derided marches – “a hate-filled crowd”, the Sun; “an elite”, the Daily Telegraph. If 16 million remainers are an elite, then we may rejoice that the UK is a model of meritocracy.

We were, in truth, the left-behinds. By the grace of Corbyn and his grim lieutenants, we had no effective voice in parliament. On her first day as prime minister, Theresa May promised outside No 10 that she would govern for us all. Instead, she threw half the country to the dogs to appease her party’s right wing. Initially, Boris Johnson’s elevation was decided by a tiny, ageing constituency, the majority of whose members told pollsters that they wished Donald Trump ruled Britain and that they longed for the return of hanging. In similar spirit, Johnson found fresh depths of populist vulgarity when he spoke last June of pitchforking the EU incubus off the nation’s back. He has realised his dream.

As for the outer extremes, the occasional milkshake aside, we never violently assaulted a Brexiter in the street; we only rarely inclined to sending anonymous death and rape threats such as came so abundantly the way of Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and many female MPs. However, the antisemitic emails from within the Labour party were a disgrace. So too was the bullying mob jeering outside the Rees-Mogg home. But we remainers did not slyly exhort our compatriots to riot in the event of a second referendum going against us. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate did not vote to leave; most of business and the trade unions, agriculture, science, finance and the arts were against the Brexit project; three-quarters of MPs voted to remain. But our representatives ignored the evident public interest and shrank behind party cabals and “the people have spoken” – that bleak Soviet locution – followed by “get Brexit done”, the mind-clouding magic dust which has blinded reason and diminished our children’s prospects.",a majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. but those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. we must pack up our tents and hope to begin the 15-year trudge.

It comes as lorry driver shortages, which have been blamed on the dual issues of Covid and Brexit, are beginning to bite across the UK.

They have begun to cripple supply chains in some industries and been partly blamed on supermarket shortages.

The cross-party UK Trade and Business Commission – consisting of MPs and business leaders – has called for new grants for businesses affected by Brexit disruption, digital checks for food exporters and a streamlining of visa processes.

Hilary Benn, Labour MP and parliamentary co-convenor of the commission, said: “The evidence we’ve heard from dozens of experts and businesses confirms that this deal is broken, and will continue to create problems in our supply chain and cost jobs and money in the UK.”

It comes as Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said in his conference speech yesterday that his party needed to ruthlessly target southern Tory seats in the next election.

Davey said many voters in these Remain voting areas “just don’t feel that Boris Johnson represents them, or shares their values”.

He added that ministers had “ignored all the warnings” about the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and UK-EU trade deal.

The Liberal Democrats’ trade spokesperson Sarah Olney claimed the Brexit deal has “led to huge delays at our ports and risks fuelling another winter of discontent”.

“We need urgent action in order to get to grips with the situation, put an end to food shortages, and rebuild valuable trading links with our European partners,” she said.

A government spokesperson said: “Last year, we secured one of the biggest and broadest trade deals in the world, worth £660bn and the only zero tariffs Free Trade Agreement the EU has ever agreed. Our deal gives us full control over our laws, meaning that UK businesses and citizens can succeed as we reform and do things better.

“We have already begun to take full advantage of these opportunities by establishing our own points-based immigration system, making our own regulations, and forging new trade deals around the world.

“As we build back better from the pandemic, we will go further and faster by launching plans to create a competitive, high-standards regulatory environment which supports innovation and growth across the UK.”","survey by Opinium on behalf of best for british think tank found just 15% of people think it has done the opposite. it comes as lorry driver shortages, blamed on the dual issues of covid and Brexit, are beginning to bite across the uk."

Parliament will be suspended today for five weeks despite the ongoing crisis surrounding Brexit, Boris Johnson's spokesman has announced.

In a historical ceremony known as ""prorogation"" to take place once Commons business is concluded on Monday evening, MPs will be summoned to the House of Lords to hear a message from the Queen halting business in both houses until 14 October.

The move means the PM will not attempt again to force a snap general election in October if MPs vote down his attempt to do so today.

Opposition parties have agreed to vote down Mr Johnson's call for an early election on 15 October, which requires a two-thirds majority in the Commons. If they go through with that decision, the earliest an election could then come will be late November - possibly the 21st or 28th.

They fear that a vote next month might allow the PM to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on Halloween, despite legislation due to become law today barring him from doing so unless he has reached a deal with Brussels or secured parliamentary approval for no-deal.

Following a meeting of opposition leaders hosted by Jeremy Corbyn this morning, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""They agreed to work together today to hold the government to account in Parliament.

""All leaders agreed that they would not support Boris Johnson's ploy to deny the people their decision by crashing us out of the EU with no deal during a general election campaign.""

The initial prorogration announcement made after leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg visited the Queen at Balmoral a fortnight ago stated that the longest prorogation since 1945 could begin on any date between 9 and 12 September.

By choosing the first possible date, Mr Johnson avoids being grilled by MPs at prime minister's questions on Wednesday as well as a 90-minute appearance before a panel of senior parliamentarians on the Commons Liaison Committee later the same day in which he could have faced questions on the activities of his adviser Dominic Cummings, the decision to slash the size of his Brexit negotiation team or his own defiance of the legal requirement to extend Brexit talks.

But it also means he has abandoned alternative routes for securing an early election, such as a vote of no confidence in his own government, or a single-line bill overruling fixed-term parliaments legislation.

Liaison committee member Hilary Benn​ said: “It is extraordinary that Boris Johnson will shut down parliament this evening for over a month at the very moment when we need our elected MPs to be in the House of Commons holding the government to account. It also means that the prime minister will avoid having to face questions from the Liaison Committee on Wednesday. I don’t think he was relishing the prospect.”

The PM's official spokesman said that while the government would obey the law Mr Johnson would not be requesting another extension of the Article 50 EU withdrawal process.

Under repeated questioning at a Westminster media briefing, he did not rule out the possibility of Mr Johnson resigning.

""The prime minister is not going to seek an extension,"" the spokesman said.

""If MPs want to resolve this there is an easy way - vote for an election today and let the public decide.""

The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Mr Johnson might appoint another minister or official to request an extension on his behalf, in order to avoid breaking his promise that he would ""die in a ditch"" rather than delay Brexit.

""The prime minister's government will not be seeking an extension,"" said the spokesman. ""The prime minister's government will not be extending the Article 50 process.""","parliament will be suspended today for five weeks despite the ongoing crisis surrounding Brexit. in a historic ceremony known as ""prorogation"", MPs will be summoned to the house of Lords to hear a message from the queen halting business until 14 October. the move means the pm will not attempt again to force a snap general election in October if MPs vote down his attempt to do so today."
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/pmnn0f/just_3m_for_cornwall_rather_than_100m_before/,https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/19571108.cornwall-get-just-3m-replacement-funding-leaving-eu/,Cornwall to get just £3m replacement funding after leaving EU,"Prior to Brexit Cornwall had qualified for funding from the European Union due to it being recognised as one of the poorest regions in Europe.

As a result Cornwall could have been receiving £100m a year to help provide economic stimulus and support projects which would provide everything from employment and skills to infrastructure.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously stated that Cornwall would not miss out on any funding that it would have received if the UK had remained in the EU.

However it has been revealed that the Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF) – which has been put forward as the mechanism to provide that replacement funding – will not fully start until 2022 and that the pilot scheme, the Community Renewal Fund (CRF), worth £220m for the whole of the country will only allow local authorities to bid for a maximum of £3m.

Cornwall Council is set to bid for the full £3m allowed, but there is not enough cash to fulfil that for every council so some councils may get less or nothing at all.

The council is set to ask for £700m from the SPF for the next ten years from 2022 to replace the funding it would have received from the EU.

In addition Cornwall Council has decided not to apply for money from the Government’s Levelling Up Fund after Cornwall was placed in the second priority band for the scheme. The council is, however, supporting a bid from the Council of the Isles of Scilly.

While Cornwall has not bid for money in the first phase of the Levelling Up programme it is considering bidding for later phases of funding.

Conservative councillors and MPs have previously highlighted that Cornwall has had millions of pounds of funding from schemes such as the Town Deals scheme and other government programmes.

But critics say that this money has not been specifically to replace the EU funding and was also available to all other parts of the country.

Tim Dwelly, independent councillor at Cornwall Council, said that the Conservative led council should now be putting pressure on the Government and Prime Minister to deliver on its promises that Cornwall would not lose out on replacement EU funding.

He said: “We are in a year when we would have had £100m coming to Cornwall if we had stayed in the EU. There is a pilot for the Shared Prosperity Fund, which is called the Community Renewal Fund, and we have been told to bid for up to £3m – and we don’t even know if that will come.

“This council chose not to apply for any Levelling Up funding and have been banging on about how a combination of funds would replace the EU money – but that is not the replacement funding, that is money which is available to all parts of the UK.

“Cornwall was given EU funding because of its unique status – there has been no replacement funding provided by the Government.

“There is Levelling Up funding, no EU replacement funding and at most £3m. Boris Johnson lied to Cornwall when he said he would match the £100m that Cornwall was set to get and now we have Conservatives running Cornwall Council covering up for that lie.

“At best Cornwall will get £3m this year – anyone can work out that is not £100m. It isn’t just levelling down, it is vicious levelling down.

“Looking to the future it is almost certain there won’t be funds anywhere near what we used to get. I have asked Cornwall Council for the assumptions they are using for what we might get in their planning. When I have looked at the figures it appears that by the very end of the SPF, when the funding will be at its highest, we will be looking to get around two-thirds of what we might have had under the EU.

“When David Harris (Deputy Leader of Cornwall Council) says there is no money he is correct, my question is when are you going to demand that money?”

Cllr Dwelly, who was previously Cabinet member for economic development before May’s elections, said that opposition councillors at County Hall would continue to press for the Government to deliver the replacement funding.

He said: “It is clear that Boris Johnson wasn’t telling the truth. For those of us who represent the 64% of voters who did not vote for the Tories to run Cornwall we want those people to know that we care about those pledges and taking money away from Cornwall.

“We will do everything we can to take back control of Cornwall from people willing to put up and excuse such appalling mistreatment of us by the Government.”","prior to Brexit Cornwall had qualified for funding from the eu. as a result it could have received £100m a year to provide economic stimulus. but the shared prosperity fund (SPF) will not fully start until 2022. the pilot scheme, the Community Renewal Fund (CRF), will only allow local authorities to bid for a maximum of £3m."

According to Make UK, it is currently hard for manufacturers to see any advantages from leaving the EU, and the organisation warns exports to the bloc could become a permanent problem if the government does not step in.

The organisations admitted its position following a meeting it had with SNP MP Angus MacNeil.

Tweeting yesterday, MacNeil said that “esentially, after their [Make UK] talking to 1000s of member businesses, no one has reported any advantages to Brexit.”

He later added large businesses are “still exporting, with hassles, to the EU, but a lot of small businesses have stopped”.

Fall

He said 17 per cent of UK exporters are no longer trading as exporters due to Brexit and that there has been a 50 per cent fall in food and drink exports.

A Make UK spokesperson told The London Economic that even before Britain had its “final departure” from the European Union, “political uncertainty was hitting exports to the bloc”.

The spokesperson added: “Now, while some opportunities are opening up elsewhere, it’s very difficult to date for manufacturers to see any benefit from leaving.

“The EU will remain our biggest trading partner through sheer fact of geography. As such, with major changes coming down the track, especially the imposition of import controls, it’s vital that government works with business and the EU to smooth out critical issues such as customs procedures.

“Otherwise there is a risk that the drop in exports to the bloc we have seen over the last couple of years will become structural and permanent.”

Reactions

As expected, Twitter users had something to say about these latest Brexit news.

Dr Charles Tannock, former Tory MEP, said: “Quelle surprise. All those Brexiteers including ministers who made such claims were just stating these on a wing and a prayer with no credible researched evidence basis on which to promote such predictions.

“All rather sad and inevitable looking back on what I’ve said for five years.”

One Twitter user said: “So far, pretty much all the advantages of Brexit have been in the EU’s favour, and you know what? I’m fine with this, EU is better off without the UK”.

‘Severe disruption’

Last week, it emerged UK manufacturing including cars and fridges could face severely disrupted supply chains because the government failed to replace the EU’s safety standards system post-Brexit.

The government admitted this was “not the desired outcome”, as it started facing a threat of failling out with businesses if new British compliance rules disrupt UK’s supply chains, with some products, such as airbags, already trapped in backlogs.

Nonetheless, the government insisted it would not extend the deadline for the shift to UK safety rules, arguing the new checks are a matter of sovereignty.

Boris Johnson has blamed seafood exporters for their post-Brexit crash in sales, claiming they are “not filling in the right forms”.

The prime minister also claimed the UK would control “all the fish” in its coastal waters in years to come – even though the EU has the right to impose harsh retaliation if it tries.

And he linked the crisis – caused by a mountain of new red tape imposed by the hard Brexit trade agreement – to the Covid-19 pandemic shutting restaurants across the Channel.

“Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the Continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic,” Mr Johnson told an interviewer.

He was put on the spot after a protest over the impact of the Brexit fishing deal in London led to 14 people being issued with fixed penalty notices.

New checks and paperwork, caused by the UK leaving the EU single market and the customs union, are causing massive delays and growing anger.

Lorries transporting freshly-caught produce have been held up at distribution hubs and many have struggled to enter into France.

Some Scottish fishermen have taken to landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the “bureaucratic system” that exports to Europe now involve.

But Mr Johnson said that “insofar as there are problems at the moment”, they were “caused by teething problems, people not filling in the right forms, or misunderstandings”.

There would be compensation “when it's not people's fault”, but, the prime minister claimed: “Be in no doubt that there are great opportunities for fishermen across the whole of the UK.”

And he added: “In just five years’ time, five and a half years’ time, we will have access to all the fish in all of our coastal waters.”

However, as The Independent revealed, the Christmas Eve deal handed the EU the ability to shut off gas and electricity supplies if the UK tries to seize control of disputed stocks.

James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food & Drink, said: “Anger amongst Scotland’s seafood exporters has been simmering for two weeks now as the door to their most important market has been slammed shut. Many now fear for their survival.

“We desperately need to press pause on the new bureaucratic checks on exports. We need time to get systems properly built as they keep falling down.”

The prime minister also repeatedly to say if the planned £1,000-a-year Universal Credit cut will go ahead in April, ahead of a Commons vote on the controversy tonight.

“What we have said is we will put our arms around the whole of the country throughout the pandemic,” he said.

“We have already done £280bn worth of support and we will keep all measures under constant review.”

And, on a visit to a Covid vaccine-manufacturing plant in Oxfordshire, he again promised the situation would look “very different by the spring”.

“We're getting it out as fast as we can, four million done so far, I think we've done more than half of the over-80s, half of the people in care homes, the elderly residents of care homes,” Mr Johnson said.

“That doesn't mean we are not going to be living with the consequences of the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic for a while to come – the economic consequences and the threat to our health as well.”","pm blames exporters for post-Brexit crash in sales, claiming they are not filling in the right forms. he also claims the UK will control ""all the fish"" in its coastal waters in years to come. he also linked the crisis to the covid-19 pandemic shutting restaurants across the channel."

A Conservative MP has broken ranks to support making Jeremy Corbyn a caretaker prime minister to avert the “generational damage” from a no-deal Brexit.

Guto Bebb criticised other parties and MPs who have rejected the Labour leader’s offer, after the Liberal Democrats branded it “nonsense”.

“Those who have said they will do anything necessary to stop the long-term damage of a no-deal exit must take seriously this type of offer,” Mr Bebb said.

“I certainly take the view that a short-term Jeremy Corbyn government is less damaging than the generational damage that would be caused by a no-deal Brexit.”

Mr Corbyn has called for Boris Johnson to be toppled – when MPs return to Westminster next month – with himself installed as a stopgap premier to block a no-deal exit on 31 October.

He has promised to call a general election, once an extension to the Article 50 process has been agreed, with a Final Say referendum on Brexit to follow if Labour wins.

Mr Bebb – who is standing down at the next election – added to growing pressure on Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, to rethink her outright opposition to Mr Corbyn’s audacious bid.

Ms Swinson accused Mr Corbyn of “demanding the keys to No 10 as a precondition for a vote of no confidence”, which Labour signalled would come within “days” of the Commons sitting on 3 September.

“What we need in a leader of an emergency government is a long-serving member of parliament who is respected on both sides of the house,” she said.

“Someone like Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman – the father and mother of the house. They are hugely experienced and, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, or indeed myself, they are not seeking to lead a government in the long term.”

But Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, issued a video message urging Ms Swinson to rethink, saying: “Jo, please change your mind. Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing.”

Urging the Lib Dem leader to join talks, Ms Lucas added: “Let’s have that negotiation with him and not reject this offer out of hand.”

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National Party leader, echoed the call, saying: “Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion is not the only possible option – but given the circumstances, nothing should be ruled out at this stage.

“It’s no secret, I’m not the greatest fan of Jeremy Corbyn, but we won’t rule out any option if it helps avert what is a looming catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit.”

Senior Tories Dominic Grieve, Caroline Spelman and Sir Oliver Letwin issued a joint letter, with former Conservative Nick Boles, welcoming talks, but did not endorse the Labour leader as a stopgap in No 10.

Green MP Caroline Lucas appeals to Jo Swinson to change her mind about Jeremy Corbyn

But Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, said: “I would not support a government of national unity that is led by Jeremy Corbyn for all manner of reasons.”

Mr Bebb’s endorsement of a Labour prime minister – even a temporary one – is certain to trigger calls for him to be stripped of the Conservative whip.

The party’s MEPs cast their votes against a European parliament resolution calling for an upgrade of the EU’s anti-propaganda unit East StratCom, as well as support for public service media.

The text passed comfortably with the support of the largest political groups in the European parliament – the centre-right European People’s party, Socialists, Liberals and Greens.

In the resolution, MEPs also criticised Facebook, accusing the social media company of not following up on most of the parliament’s demands to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where at least 87 million people had their data harvested without permission for use in targeted advertising campaigns in the 2016 US presidential election.

While the resolution is non-binding, it heightens pressure on the incoming leaders of the European commission and European council to keep a focus on countries seeking to meddle in elections and the operations of social media companies.

The text expressed “deep concern over the highly dangerous nature of Russian propaganda” and called on EU institutions to set a strategy to counter Russian disinformation.

East StratCom was set up on a shoestring budget in 2015 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced a rethink of relations with the Kremlin in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.

Its staff and funding have since been increased, but the unit has faced criticism for a handful of decisions – later reversed – to describe satirical or contrarian articles as “fake news”.

The resolution, which passed by 469 votes to 143, with 47 abstentions, revealed the bitter division among Britain’s MEPs.

The Liberal Democrats said they were “shocked and appalled” the Brexit party had voted against measures to tackle fake news.

“It is frankly shocking that Brexit party MEPs today refused to support enhanced measures to tackle attacks on our democratic processes from Russia and elsewhere,” said Catherine Bearder, the leader of Lib Dem MEPs. “They wrap themselves in the union flag, but they repeatedly fail to protect our national interest and do what is best for Britain.”

The Brexit party, which abstains or opposes most European parliament votes, hit back at the claims. “We will always vote against more power and spending by the EU,” said David Bull, a Brexit party MEP.

“We won’t take lessons in democracy from parties which have packed together in order to frustrate the Brexit vote. Stories of Russian interference have been exposed as baseless propaganda and scare stories used to shut down debate. As a party of free speech, we oppose shutting down debate.”

Facebook has previously said it intends to comply with EU laws on data protection. The company has been contacted for comment on the resolution.","the party's MEPs cast their votes against a resolution calling for an upgrade of the EU’s anti-propaganda unit East StratCom. the text passed comfortably with the support of the largest political groups in the european parliament. it also criticised facebook, accusing the social media company of not following up on most of the parliament’s demands."

Voters back remaining in the European Union by a bigger margin than at any time since the 2016 Brexit referendum, a new poll has found.

The survey, conduted after MPs overwhelmingly rejected Theresa May's deal earlier this week, found that the four-point lead secured by the Leave campaign in 2016 has turned into a 12-point lead for Remain.

56 per cent of voters now back staying in the EU compared with 44 per cent who want to leave, according to the YouGov survey.

The poll, for the People's Vote campaign, found that 56 per cent also want another referendum on Brexit - up three points in less than a month.

Among Labour supporters, the figure rises to 78 per cent - piling pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to endorse giving the public the final say on Britain's withdrawal from the EU.

The Labour leader is facing growing calls from party members and many of his MPs to back a fresh referendum but has so far refused to do so, insisting that his focus is on trying to trigger a general election.

The YouGov poll found that voters support staying in the EU by an even bigger margin if the alternative is leaving on the terms of Ms May's deal. In such a scenario, 65 per cent would back Remain, while 35 per cent would still want to leave.

If Brexit meant leaving the EU without a deal, 59 per cent would prefer to stay in, while 41 per cent would want to leave.

Commenting on the findings, Chuka Umunna MP, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “This snap poll shows more than ever why the government needs to change course and hand this decision on Brexit back to the people.

""There is now a clear and expanding majority for staying in the EU and an even bigger one when voters have the chance to look at the real options for leaving. Norway Plus and a customs union are not compromise solutions that could command a consensus, but niche positions supported by less than one in ten voters.

“The poll also underlines why the leadership of my party needs to listen to Labour’s own supporters, more than three-quarters of whom are demanding a People’s Vote. To ignore those calls now would be an historic mistake for which Labour would not be forgiven.”

The poll found that voters do not support two alternative Brexit outcomes that have been proposed by some MPs: maintaining a customs union with the EU or agreeing a Norway-style deal that would see the UK also stay in the single market.

Only 26 per cent of voters said the Norway option was ""sensible"", compared with 46 per cent who thought it was a ""bad idea"".

The possibility of staying in a customs union was even less popular, with 16 per cent of respondents supporting it and 57 per cent opposed.

Both were significantly less popular among voters than either staying in the EU or leaving without a deal.

Peter Kellner, former president of YouGov said: “Now that MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement so decisively, other compromise options have been suggested: “Norway Plus"" or a customs union-only deal. Both receive a clear thumbs-down from voters. In both cases, they are rejected as bad ideas both by Remain and Leave voters.

“Again, the poll has a strong message for Jeremy Corbyn: Labour voters back a new public vote by 78-22 per cent. The poll suggests that fewer than one in four voters oppose a fresh referendum on the grounds that it would be a rerun of the 2016 vote: just 22 per cent in the case of a Remain versus government deal referendum, 23% in the case of a Remain versus no deal referendum.”

YouGov polled 1,070 voters on Wednesday 16 January.","voters back remaining in the eu by a bigger margin than at any time since the 2016 referendum, a new poll has found. the four-point lead secured by the Leave campaign in 2016 has turned into a 12-point lead for Remain. 56 per cent of voters now back staying in the eu compared with 44 per cent who want to leave, according to the yougov poll. among labour supporters, the figure rises to 78 per cent."

Let us put an end to this national humiliation. Around the world, Britain is increasingly viewed with pity or contempt. Brexit, were it to happen, would be the most consequential and gratuitous act of national self-harm in our recent history.

It is now crystal clear that there is no available deal with the rest of the European Union that can realise even a fraction of Brexit’s stated objectives. The only good way forward is for parliament to put the question back to the people, and for the people to decide that Britain should stay in the EU. To achieve that, everyone who possibly can needs to turn out in London tomorrow to march for a people’s vote.

Two years ago there was still a possibility that Theresa May might have built broad, across-the-aisle support around a soft Brexit, with Britain as a Greater Norway, staying in the single market and some version of a customs union. This would have been a poor second best, leaving the UK as a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker, but it might at that point have represented the least unhappiness of the greatest number.

Whether a stronger prime minister could have pulled that off we shall never know. As soon as May decided to appease her hardline Tory Brexiteers, she put herself on the path to perdition. The ever more complicated, customised confusion in which she is now entangled, like a cat wrapping itself in a skein of wool, is a direct consequence of that decision to appease.

Ultimately I must be true to what we all know in our heads and feel in our hearts: the only good Brexit is no Brexit

I have worried in recent months about the apparent rigidity of Brussels’ negotiating stance, but the EU27 truly cannot be blamed for May going back on her own solemn commitment to have a backstop for Ireland unless and until other satisfactory arrangements are in place. Indeed, our European partners have now shown a willingness to go the extra kilometre, countenancing the whole of the UK staying in a backstop customs union and a longer transition period in which to negotiate the final deal.

Yet the only Brexit now available before the deadline of 29 March 2019 is a blindfold Brexit. The terms of the actual withdrawal would be agreed, but the entire future relationship would be sketched out only in the vaguest terms, in a so-called political declaration. As a former minister in the Department for Exiting the EU has observed, Britain would be walking off a gangplank into thin air.

Those who voted leave in 2016 are now all at sixes and sevens, but so are those who voted remain. Where there are two remainers you find three opinions. There are the “releavers” (now for leaving, in the name of respecting the referendum result), the experts struggling ingeniously to make the best of a bad job, and those still canvassing multiple variants of a softer Brexit. I have friends who take each of these positions, and I listen to them closely, but ultimately I must be true to what we all know in our heads and feel in our hearts: the only good Brexit is no Brexit.

Then comes a plethora of objections to a second referendum. It can’t be done. The EU27 won’t give us the extra time. It’s so complicated. What would be the question on the ballot paper? It would just prolong the agony. It would make a toxic atmosphere even more toxic. It wouldn’t solve anything.

Some of these objections are stronger than others. It will indeed be complicated to reach a simple choice. But far from prolonging the agony, this is the only way to shorten it. We have seen how difficult simply negotiating the withdrawal has been; it would take many more years to thrash out and implement a new trade agreement. This way, the nightmare could be over by next summer. We’re going to be a divided country for some time anyway, so let’s at least be a divided country in the right place. And if the majority of British voters decide we should stay in the EU, that will be a tremendous shot in the arm for the whole of Europe.

It is nonsense to say this would be undemocratic. Democracy does not mean “one people, one vote, once”. As the former Brexit minister David Davis memorably put it, a democracy is not a democracy if it can’t change its mind. Since we have had one popular vote, and have a representative democracy, the clearly legitimate path to a second referendum is through parliament.

Now a great parliamentary moment is approaching, one that will decide the future of this country for decades ahead. Most MPs are genuinely trying to work out what is the right thing to do – and then to calculate whether they can do the right thing and still get reselected and re-elected. Yet the finely balanced parliamentary arithmetic is such that it will only need a few brave spirits to ensure that whatever blindfold deal (or no-deal) May brings back from Brussels is defeated in the Commons’ “meaningful vote”. Then it will be for parliament to decide whether and how to put the question back to the people.

That’s why, after gathering at high noon in Park Lane, tomorrow’s march will end with speeches (from Sadiq Khan, Anna Soubry and Delia Smith, among others) in front of parliament. I participated in the first big people’s vote demonstration earlier this year, and while it was – with its pointed chants of “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?” – substantial, colourful and jolly, the numbers were less than overwhelming. This time it needs to be much bigger.

So here’s the message:

If you agree with former prime minister John Major that the Brexit vote was “a colossal misjudgment that will diminish both the UK and the EU”, leaving Britain “weaker and poorer”, then march with us tomorrow. If you feel that the British have a historic and moral responsibility to help the island of Ireland move irrevocably beyond bloody sectarian conflict – march. If you want a liberal, progressive England, not the xenophobic, reactionary England of Tommy Robinson and the English Defence League – march. If you think the economic and cultural concerns of those who voted for Brexit must urgently be addressed, but that Brexit will do nothing to address them – march with us.

If you want your children and grandchildren not to have worse life chances than their parents – march. If you are under 30 and realise that it’s your future that is being sacrificed, as explained by the subversively named pro-referendum campaigns Our Future Our Choice (OFOC) and For Our Future’s Sake (FFS) – then, FFS, march. If you care about Europe as a whole, not just about Britain, and grasp what a serious threat Brexit is to the whole post-1945 project of building a better Europe – march. If you understand that this demonstration is just one small part of a much larger pushback against a worldwide anti-liberal counterrevolution – march. See you there.","there is no available deal with the rest of the eu that can realise even a fraction of Brexit's stated objectives. the only good way forward is for parliament to put the question back to the people, and for the people to decide that Britain should stay in the eu."

Boris Johnson can't explain why workers' rights have vanished from Brexit deal

Jeremy Corbyn tore into Boris Johnson's promises on workers' rights and environmental protection in a testy exchange over the PM's Brexit deal.

The Labour leader hit out at the provisions in the Brexit bill which offer ""no real protection"".

And the Prime Minister ducked the crucial question about why he had moved workers' rights and environmental standards out of the legally binding withdrawal bill and into the political declaration.

The leaders clashed during a heated Prime Minister's Questions held minutes after a meeting between the two leaders over the parliamentary timetable finished without agreement.

It came after the Prime Minister's bill passed its crucial second reading but was halted in its tracks after MP's voted against

The PM decided to ""pause"" the legislation following the defeat of the programme motion.

MPs refused to allow the PM to restrict scrutiny of bill to just three days in effort to meet 31 October deadline.

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions today Mr Johnson said it is a ""great shame"" that MPs ""willed the ends but not the means"" in last night's Brexit deal votes.

Mr Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of ""delaying his own Withdrawal Bill"".

The Prime Minister hit back: “I must say I find it peculiar that [Corbyn] now wants this bill back because he voted against it last night and he whipped his entire Labour party against it.""

The protection of workers' rights is a key sticking point for Labour MPs in

The Labour leader said of Mr Johnson: ""He promised to maintain environmental, consumer and workers' rights. Why then did the Prime Minister have these commitments removed from the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement?""

Mr Johnson replied: ""I don't think we could have been clearer yesterday in our commitment to the highest possible standards for workers' rights, for environmental standards.""

He said the Prime Minister ""once said employment regulation was backbreaking"".

Mr Corbyn added: ""The provisions in the bill offer no real protection at all.""

The Labour leader also attacked the Tory PM's record on the NHS.

He told PMs: ""I hate it to break it to the prime minister, but under his government and that of his predecessor privatisation has more than doubled to £10bn in our NHS.

""There are currently 20 NHS contracts out to tender.

""And when he’s promised 40 hospitals, he then reduced that to 20 and then it turns out reconfiguration is taking place in just six hospitals.""

Mr Johnson replied: ""I must say that he is completely wrong in what he says about privatisation of the NHS and I must resist this.""

He added: ""This party and this Government believes in sound management of the economy not recklessly putting up corporation tax, not recklessly wrecking the economy ... re-nationalising companies in the way that he would do.""

The bad natured exchanges over the Brexit bill came after their meeting over the timetable which broke up without agreement.

The Prime Minister took the Labour leader up on the offer, made last night when MPs rejected Mr Johnson's timetable.

The pair met in Mr Johnson's House of Commons office.

Last night, Mr Corbyn said that Labour was prepared to work with the Government to agree ""a reasonable timetable"" to enable the Commons to debate and scrutinise the legislation properly.

""That would be the sensible way forward, and that's the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight,"" he said.

A Conservative source said: ""PM met Corbyn this morning in his office in the House of Commons to discuss whether Labour would back a timetable that allows us to actually get Brexit done rather than yet more delay.""","the labour leader hit out at the provisions in the Brexit bill which offer ""no real protection"" the pm ducked the crucial question about why he had moved workers' rights and environmental standards out of the legally binding withdrawal bill and into the political declaration."

I recently visited Skegness at the behest of the New European newspaper. Its editors wanted to know whether the Lincolnshire resort, part of a constituency which voted 75.6 per cent for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, still thinks leaving the EU was a good idea. What I found was startling.

Without exception, everyone that I spoke to felt deeply disillusioned: the man in the street, the Conservative mayor, even two former Ukippers who had led the Leave campaign. Most felt they had been sold a complete pup by Conservative politicians like Boris Johnson who used Brexit as a route to power. A few still clung to the faith, but accused the government of failing to implement Brexit properly.

I was not particularly surprised, therefore, by last week’s YouGov poll showing that support for Brexit nationwide has fallen to a record low, with 56 per cent saying we were wrong to leave and a mere 32 per cent saying we were right.

Hardline Brexiteers and their tabloid megaphones reacted furiously to another story in the Sunday Times that the government may seek a “Swiss-style” relationship with the EU. But the indisputable fact is that as the economy implodes and Britain makes common cause with the EU in the war against Russia, they are losing the argument.

Don’t take my word for it. Michael Gove, a leader of the 2016 Leave campaign, admitted to the Financial Times recently: “I ask myself all the time ‘was it the right thing to do?’ ” And Andrew Neil, hardly a soggy liberal, wrote in the Daily Mail that last Thursday’s last Autumn Statement marked “the week that Brexit died”. He explained: “The Government was supposed to create a post-Brexit low-tax, low-regulation, free-wheeling economic environment which would unleash homegrown entrepreneurs and turn Britain into a beacon for foreign investment, with enterprising business folk flooding to our shores. After Thursday, that is not going to happen.”

Meanwhile Matthew Goodwin, a British academic on the eurosceptic right, wrote last Friday that “this trend of ‘Bregret’ is accelerating”. He suspects we may have another referendum “sooner than we think – particularly after a lost decade of weak growth, declining living standards and a growing sense of national decline become intimately entwined, rightly or wrongly, with the legacy of the vote for Brexit”.

And this was what Piers Morgan tweeted the other day: “It’s time to admit that Brexit has been a disaster, exacerbated by pandemic/war, and have another referendum.”

Economic and business leaders are also becoming more vociferous at last. At its annual conference in Birmingham this week the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is urging the government to seek better relations with the EU to mitigate Brexit’s adverse consequences. The Office for Budget Responsibility acknowledged last Thursday that Brexit has had a “significant adverse impact” on British trade.

Before the Autumn Statement last week Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury Select Committee that Brexit was one of the “headwinds” damaging the economy. Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, told Bloomberg that “the UK economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit”. Simon Wolfson, the Leave-supporting chief executive of the clothing chain Next, complained: “This is not the Brexit I voted for.”

And up popped George Eustice, the Brexit-backing former environment secretary, to confess that the Australian trade agreement, supposedly one of Brexit’s flagship achievements, was “not actually a very good deal”.

Meanwhile Paris has just overtaken London as Europe’s largest stock market, India has overtaken Britain to become the world’s fifth largest economy, and asylum seekers cross the Channel to the UK in record numbers.

Take back control? Global Britain? World-beating? Brexit dividends? Brexit freedoms? Brexit benefits? How hollow and vainglorious those trite slogans all sound now. Far from receiving an extra £350m a week the NHS is close to collapse. The much-vaunted US trade deal never happened. The “pent-up tidal wave of investment” promised in the Tories’ 2019 manifesto proved equally illusory. “Like some slumbering giant we’re going to rise up and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity,” Johnson declared in his victory speech after that election. Yes, well…

Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt know all this, of course, and without explicitly saying so they are changing course. They’re now considering a relaxation of post-Brexit immigration limits to end labour shortages. They’re urgently seeking rapprochement with the EU, France and Ireland, instead of picking silly fights to shore up the Tories’ support in the Red Wall.

The Prime Minister is desperate to resolve Britain’s damaging dispute with Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol. Challenged on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 last Friday, the Chancellor ruled out rejoining the single market but promised to remove trade barriers with the EU. “Unfettered trade” with our neighbours would be “very beneficial to growth”, he acknowledged.

And then there’s the story about Britain seeking an “Swiss-style” relationship with the EU, meaning accepting a more liberal migration regime and making payments to the EU budget in return for freer trade. “I think we will be doing everything we can proactively within our power to make changes to improve things when it comes to the EU,” a source told the Sunday Times. Tory Brexiteers were furious. No 10 issued a swift denial, but there can be little doubt that someone in or close to Downing Street had been testing the waters.

There’s a big opportunity for Labour here. The tide has finally turned. There’s a sea change in the national mood. The “will of the people” is indisputably mutating. The “doomsters and gloomsters” have been proved right, and in a country beset by dire economic problems the pendulum is swinging back from the populist right to the sober centre.

In her response to Hunt’s Autumn Statement Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, made just one passing reference to the B-word when she talked of “fixing the holes in the government’s Brexit deal”, but Labour should be moving on to the offensive instead of regarding Brexit as a taboo subject.

It was a Conservative prime minister who called the 2016 referendum. It was a Conservative prime minister who led us so triumphantly out of Europe. It was right-wing Conservative zealots who demanded – and got – the hardest possible Brexit. The Tories cannot possibly distance themselves from Brexit now that their great ideological experiment is turning sour. They cannot avoid responsibility for inflicting on Britain what an ever greater chunk of the population now sees as the greatest act of economic self-harm in living memory. Labour should be seizing every opportunity to ensure the electorate never forgets that.

A poster mocking the decision by inventor and Brexit supporter James Dyson to move his firm's head office out of the UK has gone up on a giant billboard in Newcastle.

The poster highlights a statement by the Leave.eu campaign which cited Dyson as an example of business supporting a post-Brexit British economy.

The statement, framed as a Twitter post in March 2017, reads: 'They said business would flee if we voted Leave, but instead we're seeing great British innovators like Dyson investing in the UK's future!'

In a follow-up post there is a BBC News tweet from January 2019 stating that Dyson had announced it is moving it's UK head office to Singapore.

The poster is the latest in a series of bills looking at the public statements made by Brexit backers. Others have appeared in London, Leeds, Birmingham and Rochdale.

It was put up by campaigners who use the hashtag #LedByDonkeys pointing to a Twitter account, reports Chronicle Live .

On their page, they claim to be ""taking the historic Brexit pronouncements of our political leaders, turning them into tweets and slapping them up on massive billboards across the nation.""

The group have also set up a Crowdfunder page , which at the time of writing has raised £188,679.

On this page, they said: ""When we started this we were four friends who wanted to highlight the hypocrisy of our politicians on Brexit.

The report, authored by London School of Economics behavioural political scientist Florian Foos and Zurich University’s Daniel Bischof, says the long-standing Sun boycott lowered Euroscepticism among the “unskilled” working class who “made up a large share of Sun readers before the disaster”.

The report said “attitudes towards the EU got significantly more positive in Merseyside during the boycott”.

Liverpool, The Wirral and Sefton in Merseyside all voted Remain.

The study, which used data from the annual British Social Attitudes survey and is available online, added: “…the boycott of the most important Eurosceptic newspaper – The Sun in Merseyside as a consequence of The Sun’s reporting on the Hillsborough sporting disaster – led to a decrease of Euroscepticism in Merseyside, which we estimate to amount to around 11 percentage points.

“Moreover, our results suggest that The Sun boycott in Merseyside might have decreased the Leave vote share in Merseyside in the 2016 EU referendum.”

The authors said the study showed “sustained media campaigns on emerging issues can have large, lasting, and ultimately, consequential effects on public opinion, and public policy”.

Analysis of national newspapers by Press Gazette in June 2016 found a strong pro-Brexit bias among the UK’s most read titles. The research found that The Sun had been “strongly biased” in favour of leaving the European Union in terms of its front page coverage.

The Sun declined to comment for this article.

Speaking after a meeting with the prime minister in Downing Street, Antonio Tajani insisted that her triggering of the departure process last month could be reversed easily by the remaining EU members if there was a change of UK government after the general election, and that it would not even require a court case.

“If the UK, after the election, wants to withdraw [article 50], then the procedure is very clear,” he said in an interview. “If the UK wanted to stay, everybody would be in favour. I would be very happy.”

He also threatened to veto any Brexit deal if it did not guarantee in full the existing rights of EU citizens in Britain and said this protection would forever be subject to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ).

Both are potential sticking points for May, who has promised to end free movement of EU citizens and rid Britain forever of interference by the ECJ, but the European parliament must ratify any Brexit deal agreed by negotiators before it can be completed.

Lawyers are divided on whether the UK can unilaterally change its mind about leaving and are bringing a test case to establish the legal reversibility of article 50, but the parliament president spelled out a process by which a simple political decision by other member states would be sufficient.

“If tomorrow, the new UK government decides to change its position, it is possible to do,” said Tajani. “The final decision is for the 27 member states, but everybody will be in favour if the UK [decides to reverse article 50].”

Though stressing that the decision was a matter for the UK electorate alone to consider, the president’s intervention pointedly contradicted those who argue that the upcoming general election is not a second chance to consider exiting the EU.

“Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back,” said May on Tuesday as she called for a snap election and promised to strengthen the government’s mandate for pursuing Brexit on any terms.

Tajani, an Italian who recently replaced the German veteran Martin Schulz as the international representative of the key EU institution, said he had a largely positive discussion with the prime minister during their first one-on-one meeting on Thursday.

Yet he said that the European parliament would veto the entire deal if the UK did not agree to the preservation of all the rights of the estimated 3 million EU citizens already settled in the UK and the 1.2 million Britons in Europe.

“We will vote against [it],” he said, adding that he wanted “a clear framework [on EU citizens] in the next months” agreed at a political level. Negotiators would then work on the technical details covering issues such as reciprocal pensions, health, and other issues, a process that is likely to be prolonged.

He also moved to allay fears among campaigners that if May wins the election she will try to block future rights of those settled in the UK, specifically the rights of French, Polish or other EU citizens to have family members join them.

This is a right that EU citizens have been campaigning to protect as it accommodates the future care of widowed parents.

Emphasising that there should be no diminution of citizens’ rights after Brexit, he said: “For us it’s important to ensure that Brexit does not have negative effects on their life, and rights they are enjoying.

“We want the same rights as today. For us, the agreement is [to have the same rights] as today [and] yesterday, tomorrow,” he said. “For us, it is a priority and it is a red line.”

He said he was optimistic the prime minister would respect all existing rights enjoyed by European citizens because she wanted the same in return for British citizens in the rest of Europe.

He also said the ECJ would regulate the agreement on EU citizens after Brexit, thereby blocking any bid by a future government to renege on the deal.

“Under the [Brexit] treaty everything under the treaty is under the court,” said Tajani in a further contradiction of British government policy.

The EU parliament president nonetheless welcomed May’s decision to call an election, saying it was unlikely to delay Brexit talks by more than a week and would provide long-term clarity.

“To have a new government before the beginning of the negotiation is good, not only for the UK but for us, because we will have the same negotiators, the same prime minister and we will know the real situation in the UK,” said the EU president.

“It is better for us to work with the same government and not with a potential election campaign [looming].”

Tajani also struck a more positive note than some MEPs about the prospects for moving on to trade talks with Britain before the end of the two-year window allocated for the exit negotiations.

“We hope before the end of 2017 to have a framework on the exit and immediately afterwards it is possible to start with the negotiations for the day after,” said Tajani, whose press conference in the former Conservative party headquarters building in Smith Square was briefly interrupted by a phone call from the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.

“I will inform the [European] council of this meeting and that it was positive. It’s the beginning, there’s a long way but it’s important to start well.”

The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said Tajani’s remarks showed “that contrary to Theresa May’s claims, it’s not too late to prevent a divisive, hard Brexit”.

Germany has dropped discussions about Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU from a meeting of Brussels envoys next week because there has been no “tangible progress” in talks, according to EU diplomats.

Angela Merkel’s government, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, had intended to discuss the trade deal talks during the meeting of ambassadors from the 27 member states but scrapped it because of the apparent stalemate.

An EU diplomat with knowledge of the council’s agenda confirmed to Reuters that Brexit had been removed following frustration over last week’s round of talks between UK chief negotiator David Frost and his counterpart Michel Barnier, which made no headway.

“Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” an unnamed EU diplomat told The Guardian.

“We have had the whole summer completely wasted, a cabinet that doesn’t understand how the negotiations work, a prime minister who, I think, doesn’t understand how the negotiations work – because he is under the wrong impression that he can pull off negotiating at the 11th hour,” another EU official told the newspaper.

It comes amid growing pessimism in Brussels that a free trade deal can be agreed over the next six weeks. On Wednesday Mr Barnier repeated his call for an agreement before a mid-October summit of the bloc’s national leaders so it could be ratified by the end of 2020.

He said he had no plans to meet Mr Frost this week, before adding: “But perhaps next week, if conditions allow.”

Disagreements over state aid rules and fishing quotas have so far thwarted a deal. Beyond the biggest stumbling blocks, differences also linger in discussions on migration, security, dispute-settling mechanisms, human rights guarantees and other areas.

Italian MEP Sandro Gozi, Italy’s former Europe minister, said on Wednesday: “I doubt even [Angela] Merkel or [Emmanuel] Macron would be able to transform a stalemate into a positive outcome … Every day that passes without concrete progress is a day closer to no-deal Brexit.”

Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of new advisory groups have been set up to support the UK’s post-Brexit trade talks.

The Department for International Trade has set up 11 groups covering a range of areas, such as life sciences and financial services, to help advise on negotiations.

The launch of the new advisory groups comes as ministers seek to step up talks with countries including Japan, the US, Australia and New Zealand. International trade secretary Liz Truss said that the government wants to strike deals benefiting “every part” of the UK.

“Talks with Japan, the US, Australia and New Zealand are entering their crucial latter stages, so it is only right that we step up engagement with vital industries to utilise their technical and strategic expertise,” she said.",germany has dropped discussions about Brexit negotiations from a meeting of Brussels envoys next week because there has been no 'tangible progress' in talks. a diplomat with knowledge of the council’s agenda confirmed to Reuters that Brexit had been removed following frustration over last week’s round of talks between UK chief negotiator David Frost and his counterpart Michel Barnier.
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/i3dbc8/number_of_uk_citizens_emigrating_to_eu_has_risen/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/04/number-of-uk-citizens-emigrating-to-eu-has-risen-by-30-since-brexit-vote,Number of UK citizens emigrating to EU has risen by 30% since Brexit vote,"The number of British nationals emigrating to other EU countries has risen by 30% since the Brexit referendum, with half making their decision to leave in the first three months after the vote, research has found.

Analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat shows that migration from Britain to EU states averaged 56,832 people a year in 2008-15, growing to 73,642 a year in 2016-18.

The study also shows a 500% increase in those who made the move and then took up citizenship in an EU state. Germany saw a 2,000% rise, with 31,600 Britons naturalising there since the referendum.

“These increases in numbers are of a magnitude that you would expect when a country is hit by a major economic or political crisis,” said Daniel Auer, co-author of the study by Oxford University in Berlin and the Berlin Social Science Center.

According to interviews, half chose to leave the UK quickly. “Another important finding from the empirical evidence associated with Brexit is reduced levels of consideration and level-headedness in decision-making, with increases in levels of impulsiveness, spontaneity and corresponding risk-taking,” the researchers said.

While the withdrawal agreement signed in January enshrines the residency, work and social rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of the bloc, it failed to guarantee the free movement rights of British migrants, restricting future employment and residency prospects in other member states.

Co-author Daniel Tetlow said that “Brexit was by far the most dominant driver of migration decisions since 2016”. The jump in citizenship was “further evidence that an increasing number are making migration decisions to protect themselves from some of the most negative effects of Brexit on their lives”, the report said.

The key loss for British nationals is the freedom to move country within the EU or to work or offer services across a border. This does not apply to EU nationals in the UK who retain free movement rights beyond Brexit courtesy of their EU member state citizenship.

It means that unless British nationals take out citizenship in their host country, they can no longer work in or offer a service to another EU member state, impacting professions including accounting, law, architecture, translation and health.

The biggest jump in migration was to Spain, where an estimated 380,000 British nationals live. Registration has not been essential in the country so many have lived there without being included in official Spanish immigration data, with an average of just 2,300 a year registering as migrating to the country between 2008 and 2015. After the referendum, this jumped fivefold, with 21,250 registrations in the two years between 2016 and 2018.

The second most popular country for British nationals was France, which does not require registration of EU migrants. Between 2008 and 2015 the number of registrations was just over 500 a year. After the referendum this rose tenfold with 5,000 registrations over the following two years.

In Germany, 14,600 Britons had dual nationality in 2019 compared to 622 in 2015. A total of 31,600 applied and received German citizenship in the three years after the referendum (2016 to 2019) with another 15,000 German passports expected for 2020. Overall half the estimated 120,000 Britons in Germany are expected to have dual citizenship by the end of this year.

Interviews with migrants in Germany for the study found those who had made the move to the EU since 2015 considered it a “big risk” but were prepared to make the trade-off to secure future residency and employment routes across 27 countries.

Tetlow said the rise in naturalisation numbers was a striking commitment “to integrate or socially embed”, with an increase in language learning and community involvement. “We’re observing a new social integration phenomenon and a redefining of what it means to be British European. In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians,” he added.

Case study

Andreas Mitchell’s family moved from Scotland to Germany in 2018 after the 20-year-old was diagnosed with a form of leukaemia and they feared Brexit could delay medicines or treatment.

Andreas said: “About six months after the referendum I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. I was getting treatment but these kind of things can start deteriorating over the years, and eventually we decided we should probably leave in case things started to get difficult.

“We had a fear that if a hard Brexit came there could be delays at the border with medicines coming through and my treatment would have to be prioritised and it would get interrupted by two or three weeks. With leukaemia you can’t wait a few weeks.”

He added: “It became a question of should we stay, things deteriorating financially for the family – petrol into Aberdeen every day mounts up cost-wise and there was a risk if my treatment got postponed.”

Mitchell’s German-born mother, Uschi, says they loved their life and home in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and they miss their family and friends there – but the town and area have already changed significantly because of Brexit.

“Even without Covid-19 the economy had started to contract. People and investors alike became increasingly cautious when it came to spending money,” she said.

They also considered Ireland and Italy, but Uschi got a job in Germany. Fear over Brexit was “the main factor”, she added. “Where we were wasn’t brilliant for work so we thought we would not be able to sustain ourselves and Andreas’s diagnosis was a big scare, so Brexit was the big push in the end.”","migration from Britain to EU states averaged 56,832 people a year in 2008-15, growing to 73,642 a year in 2016-18. study also shows a 500% increase in those who made the move and then took up citizenship in an EU state. biggest jump in migration was to Spain, where an estimated 380,000 British nationals live."

A crowdfunding campaign to have Boris Johnson prosecuted over his claims about Brexit has received £24,000 in donations in just two days.

The ""Brexit Justice"" campaign has hired barristers to work on a legal case relating to an alleged ""abuse of public trust"" by Mr Johnson over his claim that Britain pays £350m a week to the EU.

The former foreign secretary has previously been warned by the UK’s official statistics watchdog that the figure is a “misuse of public statistics”

Almost 700 people donated to the fund within 48 hours of it being launched, while celebrities such as Sir Alan Sugar and Paloma Faith tweeted their support.

The campaign has instructed barrister Lewis Power QC in an attempt to have Mr Johnson put on trial for criminal charges of misconduct in public office. The offence carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

Mr Power, who specialises in cases relating to organised crime, war crimes and terrorism, believes there are sufficient grounds for prosecuting the MP.

The campaigners are now seeking to raise £500,000 in 42 days to cover the costs of bringing a private prosecution against the former foreign secretary.

They have published a 48,000-word document detailing their evidence against Mr Johnson. Once the money has been raised, a case against him will be presented at the magistrates court.

The attempt is being organised by campaigner Marcus J Ball, who wants to bring criminal cases against politicians he says “have abused their duties and the trust of the public” over Brexit.

He has already crowdfunded £200,000 to appoint the legal team to work on the case, and the extra money is needed to bring their case to court.

Mr Hall said: “Our prosecution case rests upon Mr Johnson’s claims that the UK ‘sends’, ‘spends’ or ‘pays’ £350m every week on EU membership. The UK does not ‘send’, ‘spend’ or ‘pay’ this amount of money. There is an abatement, not a rebate.

“The abatement money is deducted from the total before the rest is sent to the EU. We have evidence that Mr Johnson is fully aware of this, yet decided to advance knowingly incorrect claims on multiple occasions. Put simply, he lied. This is an abuse of public trust and contrary to the public interest.”

He denied the campaign was an attempt to stop Brexit, saying: “As far as we’re aware, the courts do not have the power to reverse Brexit or order a second referendum. What the courts do have the power to do is address knowingly false statements advanced by elected officials to further their agendas.”

He added: “If we win this case, we could establish a precedent in the common law making it illegal for elected representatives to lie to the public about public spending. It is also possible, given the criminal nature of the offence, that Mr Johnson will receive a prison sentence.”

Mr Johnson has previously been rebuked over the £350m a week claim.

Last year, Sir David Norgrove, head of the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to him saying: “I am surprised and disappointed that you have chosen to repeat the figure of £350m per week, in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending when we leave the European Union.

“This confuses gross and net contributions. It also assumes that payments currently made to the UK by the EU, including for example for the support of agriculture and scientific research, will not be paid by the UK government when we leave. It is a clear misuse of official statistics.”

Boris Johnson: 'It is not too late to save Brexit'

Sir David’s predecessor, Sir Andrew Dilnot, had also called use of the £350m figure “misleading”.

Mr Johnson has previously defended his use of the figure.

Earlier this year he told The Guardian: “There was an error on the side of the bus. We grossly underestimated the sum over which we would be able to take back control.

“As and when the cash becomes available – and it won’t until we leave – the NHS should be at the very top of the list.”

Mr Johnson’s team did not respond to request for comment.","campaign hires barristers to work on a legal case relating to an alleged ""abuse of public trust"" by former foreign secretary. 700 people donated to the fund within 48 hours of it being launched. campaigners are now seeking to raise £500,000 in 42 days to cover the costs of bringing a private prosecution against the former foreign secretary."

Speaking to the Institute for Government on Monday, Rogers said the people around the prime minister at the start of the article 50 process “didn’t know very much about European councils or that much about the EU”.

Rogers, who resigned a year ago and has developed a reputation for producing some of the most caustic assessments of the misunderstandings between the UK and the EU, said the UK lived under the illusion that it could circumvent Brussels by making direct deals with the major capitals.

He said: “Capitals obviously matter, but I think having lived through this with a number of prime ministers, a number of different negotiations ... that reflex in the British system always to think that we can deal direct with the organ grinders and not the monkeys: it never works like that.

“It didn’t work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either. That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It’s done via the bureaucrats, and the sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.”

Rogers also warned that the chances of a no-deal Brexit sticking for long were close to zero. “The UK and EU know there is no chance of no-deal Brexit being the long-term end state, as the UK would quickly come back to the negotiating table,” he said. “There is not a world where we are going to end up with no deal.”

He also warned the UK could face a legal challenge to the European court of justice if it sought to stay temporarily in the EU by extending article 50 for more than three months, but also tried to avoid participation in the May European parliamentary elections.

He said the only talks extension on offer to the UK from the EU may be as long as nine to 12 months, since the EU will not wish to grant an extension simply because the UK is in a state of political chaos. He added if unelected UK MEPs remained in the European parliament, it was possible that any newly appointed commission, endorsed by that parliament, would be struck down as illegal.

Rogers said the issue of whether the UK should contribute into the EU budget would come up in April. He also said there was no chance that the UK would be able to disentangle itself from the EU even if Brexit goes ahead.

He said: “These fantasies of release and liberation – they are fantasies. We are going to be negotiating on everything from aviation to farming for evermore with our biggest neighbour. We cannot live in glorious isolation. Talk to the Swiss and to the Norwegians – they live in a permanent state of negotiation with the EU.”

He also said he was deeply concerned that May had in the negotiations prioritised goods over services “even though it’s a modest proportion of the economy”.

Rogers predicted a huge blame game between the EU and May if she is unable to get an adjusted deal through the Commons, followed by a brutal row over the UK’s requirement to pay its outstanding negotiated payments to the EU.","former ambassador to the eu says theresa may did not understand how the eu works. he said the people around the pm at the start of the article 50 process ""didn’t know very much about European councils or that much about the EU"" he warned the chances of a no-deal Brexit sticking for long were close to zero."

Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through central London on Saturday afternoon to demand a People’s Vote on Britain’s final Brexit deal.

Organisers said they believed the total number of attendees to be in excess of 500,000, as politicians and activists from across the political spectrum came together to call for the British people to be given a second say on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.

The demonstration gathered at 12pm on Park Lane before masses of protesters began their route through the centre of the capital. The march was led by young voters and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, after over 150 coaches brought demonstrators to the capital from across the UK, with some coming from places as remote as Orkney.

In the crowd, fury at those responsible for Brexit was palpable, with signs branding Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg “liars” and chants of “What do we want? A People’s Vote. When do we want it? Now!” as masses of people descended onto Parliament Square.

Speaking to JOE, Oli Jones, 32, said he had travelled to the protest with his young son, because his wife is from the Czech Republic and Britain’s withdrawal from the EU had plunged their future into doubt.

“I’m here for the same reason as all these people,” he said. “Because Brexit is a ridiculous farce. We think that it is important that our family is here.

“But it’s not just that, leaving the EU could also end the United Kingdom as we know it. It could destroy the union because if we leave the EU and the Scots decide to split and become independent, then it will just be [England] alone on an island.”

At the head of the protest Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was joined by Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry, former Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who held a sign together demanding “a final vote on the Brexit deal.” Lib Dem leader Sir Vince and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas were also in attendance.

But this was a protest that galvanised support from young and old alike. Fifteen-year-old Amy – who has yet to take her GCSEs – travelled to the protest from the outskirts of London along with two friends with handmade placards reading “Knowing me, Knowing EU… there’s nothing we can do,” “We love the EU” and “Bollocks to Brexit.”

Explaining why she was attending the protest, she said: “I came here to get my voice heard because Brexit is just a bad idea and it affects our future more than the older generation.

“There’s a huge sense of community in being in the European Union. Leaving the EU won’t benefit the UK, we’ll just lose out and it will detract from our future.”

The organisers of @peoplesvote_uk estimate that 570,000 people have marched today. Thousands still making their way past Downing Street towards Parliament Square. Chants of “What do we want?

Having initially estimated attendance at the march at 570,000 people, People’s Vote organisers later revised the figure to 670,000. If true, the number would make Saturday’s demonstration one of the largest to be held in the UK this century – second only to the 2,000,000 people believed to have demonstrated against the War in Iraq.

JOE asked Alastair Campbell why he thought anyone should listen to the demonstration when his own government ignored the much larger Stop the War march. He said: “We were well aware that millions of people opposed it and millions of people marched against it. But we had a united cabinet, a vote in parliament and, let me tell you, Tony Blair won another election after it.”

Meanwhile 64-year-old Andrew Burgin told JOE that he was at the protest to oppose a “Tory Brexit” led by Theresa May’s government and linked the vote to the “rise of the right” across Europe.

Despite huge numbers taking to the streets, Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum on Brexit. Recent research has suggested that over two and a half million people have now changed their mind and no longer want to leave the European Union, and that a majority of Brits believe the decision to leave was wrong in hindsight.","thousands of protesters marched through central london to demand a People’s Vote. the march was led by young voters and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. signs branding Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg 'liars'"

Just one in seven Britons think the draft Brexit deal proposed by Theresa May is better than either a ""no-deal"" Brexit or remaining in the EU, a Sky Data poll reveals.

The prime minister warned that these were the only three options available to Britain after concluding negotiations with the trading bloc.

Her cabinet appeared to have backed the draft deal, but several ministers including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have since resigned to oppose the proposed deal.

Over half - 54% - would prefer to remain in the EU, while 32% would prefer to leave the EU without a deal - just 14% would choose Brexit on the terms negotiated by the government.

Just over half of Britons - 55% - would also support a referendum choosing between those three options, with 35% opposed and 10% unsure.

Some 44% strongly support such a move.

Mrs May remains the most trusted politician to lead the country to Brexit among the leaders we asked about - but in total, many more people are backing alternative leaders than supporting her.

Three in 10 (31%) think she is the best person to lead the country through Brexit - ahead of Jeremy Corbyn on 24%, Jacob Rees-Mogg on 18%, Boris Johnson on 17% and Dominic Raab on 10%.

Personal finances

Last week, a Savanta ComRes poll for The Independent showed most Brits don’t think their personal finances will be better as a result of Brexit.

The survey found no region, social class or age group thinks Brexit will benefit them financially – with only 22 per cent of the total amount of Leave voters thinking they will have personal gains from exiting the EU.

And over a third of voters said they think their personal finances will suffer because of Brexit.

Boris Johnson – honest about levelling up?

Findings suggest voters think Boris Johnson should prioritise “levelling up”, but only 28 per cent believe he is honest in claiming to work towards achieving equality among UK’s different areas.

The strongest scepticism came from the North and the Midlands – areas the prime minister vowed to help.

The survey also found that more than 56 per cent of voters think their lives will be worse because of rising costs of food, energy and housing – and many are also worried about Brexit and recent Tory changes to tax rates.

Fears over living costs were strongest among the elderly, with 73 per cent of over 65s concerned about their finances.

Around 43 per cent of the poll responses revealed Brits worry their financial situation will worsen over the coming year.

Writing in the Observer, Sadiq Khan says that, with so little time left to negotiate, there are now only two possible outcomes: a bad deal for the UK or “no deal” at all, which will be even worse. “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods,” he writes.

Khan says that backing a second referendum was never something he expected to have to do. But so abject has been the government’s performance, and so great is the threat to living standards and jobs, he says, that he sees no alternative than to give people a chance to stay in the EU.

“This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the government, or a vote on a ‘no-deal’ Brexit if one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” he writes. “People didn’t vote to leave the EU to make themselves poorer, to watch their businesses suffer, to have NHS wards understaffed, to see the police preparing for civil unrest or for our national security to be put at risk if our cooperation with the EU in the fight against terrorism is weakened.”

The intervention from one of Labour’s most powerful politicians will put yet more pressure on the party leader Jeremy Corbyn to throw his support behind another referendum at Labour’s annual conference, which opens in Liverpool next weekend.

More than 100 anti-Brexit motions, and motions backing another referendum, or people’s vote, have been submitted by constituency parties – believed to be a record for any single issue in the party’s recent history.

A large number of the motions are from the left of the party, and call for a commitment to a people’s vote to be inserted into Labour’s next general election manifesto.

Sam Tarry, national political officer of the TSSA union, who used to work for Corbyn, said the left of the Labour party was uniting behind demands for another vote: “The sheer weight of anti-Brexit motions going to conference is unlike anything I have ever seen – and the only force in the Labour party capable of pulling that off is the left. The trade union movement has moved quickly towards an anti-Tory Brexit position this summer. There is this feeling that we, the socialist left, simply cannot stand by and watch while workers and communities are sacrificed at the altar of Tory dogma and imperial nostalgia.”

Until now Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said they would prefer the public to be given a say on Brexit in a fresh general election, adding that, if one does not happen soon, the option of a second referendum should remain open. But leftwingers in the party now say this formula is not sufficient, and want a commitment to another referendum in the next manifesto.

Alena Ivanova, a leading activist for the grassroots group Momentum in east London, said: “This is a campaign now being led by the left... Tory Brexit is a fundamental threat to the rights and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour represents, driven by bosses and rightwing ideologues. We will only stop it with unashamed leftwing internationalism and, crucially, that will also help us in the campaign to get the Corbyn government we need.”

Recognition of the case for a new referendum also appears to be growing in Tory circles. On Saturday the Conservative MP George Freeman, a former chair of Theresa May’s policy board, said on Twitter that pressure for a second vote would become “overwhelming” should moderate Conservatives fail to shape a sensible Brexit deal.

Last week the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, warned the cabinet that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the financial crisis that crippled the economy a decade ago. He also said that house prices could fall by 35% over three years in the worst-case scenario.

Theresa May will travel to Salzburg in Austria on Wednesday in another attempt to sell her Chequers deal on Brexit to EU leaders at an informal summit. Several European leaders, as well as the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, have already raised serious doubts about key elements of the plan.","more than 100 anti-Brexit motions and motions backing another referendum have been submitted by constituency parties. a large number of the motions are from the left of the party, and call for a commitment to a people’s vote to be inserted into labour’s next general election manifesto."

With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looming and increasing fears over food and medicine supplies after March 29th, many Leave voters have taken to telling anyone who will listen that fears are unfounded because Britain survived the Blitz, and therefore the little matter of walking away from one of the largest trading unions in the world is no big deal.

Brexiter Simon Williams, who was born in 1958 and technically therefore didn’t ‘survive’ either of the World Wars took to social to media, saying ,”We survived The Blitz, won two World Wars and beat that German lot once in a game of football.

“I was only eight at the time, and I was drunk when I was watching it so barely remember the game itself, but I’m told it was a complete drubbing of those continental bastards.

“A no-deal Brexit, like The Blitz, might cause a bit of disruption for the first week or so, but no-one will die, mark my words.

“Wait, what’s that? Over forty thousand civilians died in the Blitz? But I thought we won the war? Those statistics are fake news, mate.”

Historian and whingeing remoaner Christopher James told us, “Unfortunately, there is a trend of viewing historical conflicts through rose-tinted glasses, but sometimes the rose tint comes from blood splatters.

Products from Japan or South Korea would be stamped “Made in Britain”, under Boris Johnson’s plan to save the domestic car industry after Brexit.

The proposal is an attempt to prevent punishing tariffs driving away the likes of Nissan and Toyota, but will sound “ridiculous” to voters promised huge benefits from leaving the EU, one trade expert said.

It also means the UK is effectively asking the EU for the benefits of a customs union, a new analysis says – despite the prime minister insisting the UK is leaving the trading arrangement.

It has been uncovered in London’s proposals for an EU trade deal, which remain in trouble after face-to-face talks which broke up a day early despite the looming December deadline.

Goods made solely from foreign parts, but assembled in the UK – most notably vehicles, but also prepared foods and other manufactured goods – would be granted the same exemptions from tariffs as those from UK components.

Recommended Government plans new Brexit bureaucracy for British businesses

Alan Winters, professor of economics at the University of Sussex Business School, said it reflected the reality that a tariff-free deal – even if agreed with Brussels – was of no use if it fell foul of strict rules of origin.

Pointing to Nissan’s threat to leave the UK if it had to pay tariffs, he told The Independent: “We know that the Japanese are wondering whether they would stay around.

“Brexit is going to be bad news for jobs in lots of dimensions. In this one dimension, the British proposal would help to head off some of those losses.”

And Dr Peter Holmes, reader in economics, said: “What the UK government is seeking from the EU on rules of origin is unprecedented.

“To the average Brexit supporter this approach may sound ridiculous and not part of any deal they voted for, but without it Japanese car plants risk facing 10 per cent tariffs on cars made in the UK if they use engines, gearboxes or other components made in Japan.”

However, Dr Holmes suggested the EU would “do all in its power to stop the UK becoming a duty free offshore assembly base”.

The automotive sector was worth £18bn to the UK economy in 2018, directly employing 168,000 people and hundreds of thousands more in supply, retail and servicing.

But it is at risk from rules of origin demanding around 55 per cent of the value of a good must come from the UK or the EU to benefit from tariff reductions – because, typically, the figure is only 44 per cent for a “made in UK” car, the study says.

The new proposal would apply where the UK hopes to “roll over” an existing EU trade deal, a list of about 70 nations topped by Japan and South Korea.

Downing Street has been asked to respond to the analysis of the request made to Brussels.

The study, by the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) at the University of Sussex, has identified other areas where the government is seeking “deeper integration” than in other EU trade deals – despite its rhetoric.

These include financial services and the recognition of professional qualifications – where it warned of disputes which would hit skilled specialists seeking to work on the continent.

The UK was after recognition of professional qualifications as “the default option”, unless there are specific reasons why this was impossible, which the EU is likely to agree to, it warned.

Health care professionals, architects, veterinary surgeons and pharmacists were among groups at risk who currently enjoy “relatively easy” recognition of their qualifications within the EU.","products from Japan or south Korea would be stamped ""Made in Britain"" under Boris Johnson’s plan to save the domestic car industry after Brexit."

Jeremy Corbyn and opposition leaders have united behind plans to use legislation to block a no-deal Brexit, as proposals for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister were put on ice.

At crunch talks convened by the Labour leader, senior MPs war-gamed legislative tactics to thwart no deal, which they hope to employ when parliament returns next week.

Opposition party leaders described the meeting as “positive”, after being reassured by Mr Corbyn that Labour would throw its weight into Commons battles rather than calling a premature vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson.

The Independent previously revealed that senior MPs involved in the efforts to thwart no deal believe the most likely chance of success would be a bill compelling the prime minister to seek an extension from the EU if there is no deal in place by Halloween.

On a frenetic day in Westminster, Mr Corbyn also appealed to more than 116 Conservative and independent MPs – including Theresa May and Philip Hammond – to work with him to stop a chaotic Brexit.

Elsewhere, cross-party MPs met at Church House – the wartime home of parliament – to sign a declaration to do “whatever is necessary” to stop no deal.

Action has ramped up significantly in Westminster ahead of the end of the summer recess, as MPs prepare to challenge the prime minister over his “do or die” pledge to leave the EU on 31 October.

Mr Corbyn gathered the Westminster leaders of the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and the Independent Group for Change in his Commons office for an hour-long meeting on Tuesday.

Sources in the room said the MPs spoke briefly about calling a vote of no confidence in the prime minister but dedicated most of the hour-long meeting to discussing tactics to create a legal barrier to no deal.

Further talks will be held in the coming days.

In a joint statement, the parties said: “Jeremy Corbyn outlined the legal advice he has received from shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti which calls Boris Johnson’s plans to suspend parliament to force through a no deal ‘the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory’.

“The attendees agreed that Boris Johnson has shown himself open to using anti-democratic means to force through no deal.

“The attendees agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence.”

The show of unity comes after the Liberal Democrats poured cold water over Labour’s plan to topple the government and appoint Mr Corbyn as a temporary prime minister.

Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, called for the parties to unite behind another candidate, such as Tory grandee Ken Clarke or Labour’s Harriet Harman.

Speaking to The Independent after the talks, Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the meeting had a “very positive spirit”.

She said: “What we agreed upon is we will work upon a legislative approach and that we will be implementing that as soon as we can [next week].”

Ms Saville Roberts added party leaders are “still discussing the actual methodology” of how the legislative route might work.

SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said opposition leaders were “committing to work together effectively to prevent a catastrophic no-deal”.

He told The Independent outside the meeting: “This is a crisis. We have to stop no deal and there was a real willingness from all of us in that room to work together.”

Mr Blackford confirmed the MPs intend to “bring forward legislation to remove that cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October”.

He added: “We know we have a majority in parliament against no deal. We have to give voice to that.”

Ms Swinson said the focus of the opposition should be the pursuit of legislative means to stop a no-deal Brexit. She added they would act as “soon as possible”.

Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, said: “The legislative route is the way to stop it … We are not going to go into all the detail on it but it is about parliament doing its job, about MPs doing our job, representing our constituents.

“We need legislation to stop us crashing off a cliff on 31 October and we have agreed on that and we would support it.”

Afterwards, Mr Corbyn also fired off an appeal to his former opponent, Ms May, and a string of ex-cabinet ministers who were sacked by Mr Johnson for opposing a chaotic exit from the EU.

The Labour leader said: “We know there is a majority in parliament against no deal.

“As MPs, we’ve voted against no deal on a number of occasions and we did so in the largest number on March 27 of this year.

“As you were one of 116 Conservative or independent MPs who voted against no deal that day and are not on the government frontbench, I am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross-party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent no deal.”

A No 10 source said the plots to stop a no-deal Brexit were “utterly perverse” and accused Mr Corbyn and his allies of “actively seeking to sabotage the UK’s position”.

The source said: “This coalition of anti-democrats should be honest with the British public, they are against us leaving the EU no matter what.

“The government believes politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.”

Meanwhile, Sajid Javid sparked fresh speculation over the prospect of an early general election when his first speech as chancellor was cancelled.

Mr Javid had been due to give an address in Birmingham on Wednesday but the Treasury said it had been rescheduled, as the spending review was to be fast-tracked to early September.","Jeremy corbyn and opposition leaders have united behind plans to use legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. senior MPs war-gamed legislative tactics to thwart no deal, which they hope to employ when parliament returns next week. cross-party MPs met at church house to sign a declaration to do “whatever is necessary” to stop no deal."

A Brexit Party MEP has prompted derision after complaining that Britain will have no representation at EU level after it leaves.

June Mummery, one of the party's 29 representatives elected to the European Parliament last year, suggested the loss of MEPs would make it hard to hold Brussels to account.

""The big question now is, who will be here to hold these people to account while they still control Britain’s waters, but the UK has no representation?"" she tweeted.

Britain will lose its MEPs, EU commissioner and seats on the EU council after Brexit – leaving it with no control over the bloc's polices or political direction.

However, because of the EU's dominant position in international trade, its policies are expected to have a significant impact on the UK even after Brexit.

The UK will also be directly bound to EU rules during the transition period until 2021, while Brussels has said any trade agreement will likely require some level of permanent alignment on Britain's part.

Ms Mummery's comments prompted an immediate reaction from across the political spectrum.

""If only somebody hadn’t lied and said there was no accountability, maybe people would have voted differently,"" said SNP MP Peter Grant.

Dr Charles Tannock, a former Conservative MEP from the party's pro-EU wing, joked: ""Surely our British fish under UK sovereign control swimming in UK exclusive economic zone will respect true Brexit and stay out of EU common fisheries policy waters so all will be well?""

Lib Dem MEP Jane Brophy said: ""It took a long time but finally a Brexit MEP realised what Brexit means. I fear for our country and all the people that are in for a big shock.""

Labour MEP Rory Palmer added: ""[I'm] thinking the Brexit Party briefing for Brexit Party MEPs on what Brexit means might need some work.""

The UK will leave the bloc at the end of this month under a withdrawal deal struck by Boris Johnson in the autumn. Once the UK has left, trade negotiations will start to determine the future relationship between the two orders.

A Brexit Party spokesperson said: ""In this tweet, Mrs Mummery is rather obviously commenting on the deficiencies of the so-called 'transition period' not of Brexit itself.""

They added: ""Those who misrepresent the tweet are either ignorant of the withdrawal agreement or are willfully misunderstanding her words for their own anti-Brexit and anti-democratic ends.""","June Mummery, one of the party's 29 representatives elected to the european parliament last year, suggested the loss of MEPs would make it hard to hold Brussels to account. she tweeted: ""the big question now is, who will be here to hold these people to account while they still control Britain’s waters, but the UK has no representation?"""

The EU has set Britain a test it “cannot meet” with its demands to see a replacement for the Irish backstop, the Brexit secretary has said.

Stephen Barclay said the UK should be given another year to find a new policy for the Northern Ireland border.

The intervention comes as Downing Street said it would not be bound by an “artificial deadline” in talks.

“We are told the UK must provide legally operative text by the 31 October,” the cabinet minister Mr Barclay said in a speech in Madrid on Thursday.

“Yet the alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the implementation period in December 2020.

“And this will be shaped by the future relationship – which is still to be determined.

“In short why risk crystallising an undesirable result this November, when both sides can work together – until December 2020.

“In summary, the EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK parliament has rejected three times.”

The plea for more time was made after Emmanuel Macron and the Finnish presidency of the EU issued an ultimatum in Paris on Wednesday, giving Boris Johnson until the end of September to table workable proposals – or “it’s over”.

The UK is yet to meet EU requests to propose a concrete alternative to the Irish backstop, which Mr Johnson says must be scrapped. EU officials fear they may be “led up the garden path” by British negotiators, who had been visiting the EU capital frequently for talks, but with little sign of actual progress.

The admission is an about-face by the British government. Speaking alongside Angela Merkel in Berlin last month, Mr Johnson said he was “more than happy” with the “blistering timetable” of finding a replacement for the backstop within 30 days.

A European Commission spokesperson on Thursday afternoon confirmed the UK had sent “some documents” to Brussels ahead of a visit by Mr Barclay to meeting with Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, on Friday.

But a UK government spokesperson confirmed that the papers were not a concrete written proposal, telling reporters: “We have been having detailed discussions with the Commission’s taskforce 50 [negotiating team] in recent weeks. We have now shared in written form a series of confidential technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward.

“We will table formal written solutions when we are ready, not according to an artificial deadline, and when the EU is clear that it will engage constructively on them as a replacement to the backstop.”

The December 2020 date named by Mr Barclay is the end of the transition period negotiated by Theresa May. The EU has consistently said that if the withdrawal agreement is not approved, there cannot be a transition period – and that without a Northern Ireland backstop, there cannot be a withdrawal agreement.

Mr Barclay’s latest statement is essentially a request for the EU to drop any demand for a backstop in the withdrawal agreement, and let the UK have a transition period without a backstop in place.

The transition period can be extended by another two years beyond December 2020 with the agreement of both the EU and UK, though the prime minister said earlier this week he had no “intention” to do so.

A European Commission spokesperson told reporters in Brussels on Thursday: “What I can confirm is that we have received documents from the UK. On this basis we will have technical discussions today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods, and sanitary and phytosanitary rules.

“Then the discussions will also take place at political level because Michel Barnier, the commission’s chief negotiator, will meet Steve Barclay tomorrow, on Friday.”",the prime minister sent lawmakers home on 9 September until 14 october. the pm sent lawmakers home on 9 september until 14 october. the pm sent lawmakers home on 9 september until 14 october.

Planning documents into the Government’s preparations for leaving the European Union without a deal was leaked to the media over the weekend, warning of shortages in fuel, food and medicines.

But Downing Street has dismissed calls from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to publish the report, with Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly suggesting people would misconstrue the purpose of the document.

Mr Cleverly also claimed the document, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, was “out of date” despite his tacit admission that it was produced just three weeks ago.

‘Not predictions’

Asked why the report should not be made public, he told BBC Breakfast: “Because it’s an internal document for the government. It’s not a series of predictions.

“And the fact that we’re having this conversation shows that people misunderstand the nature of that document.”

“I think, as he does with many other things, Jeremy Corbyn has misunderstood what this is.”

The Yellowhammer report has sparked significant concern among the business community leading to the National Freight Association to accuse the government of hiding the worst-case scenario from the sector.

David Wells, the FTAs chief executive, said the details that emerged from the documents came as a “complete shock” as he urged ministers to come clean on what a no-deal Brexit would entail.

Worst case scenario

But Mr Cleverly sought to play down the dossier, insisting it was an old document that was based on “worst-case scenarios which the government takes action to avoid and mitigate”.

Speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, he twice refused to deny the report was produced on 1 August, making it just three weeks old.

“The document is an internal government document,” he said. “The reason it is out of date is because the government has enhanced its no deal planning.”

The dossier, leaked to The Sunday Times, suggested there would be delays at ports for three months, a hard border in Ireland, rising costs of food, fuel and social care due to restricted supplies and higher inflation, as well as the closure of two oil refineries and delays at Gibraltar’s border with Spain.

It also warned that the effects of a no-deal Brexit would disproportionately hit poorer communities because more of their money goes on food and fuel.

What is this but sleaze?,"There is a close link between the parliamentary sleaze scandal and – you’ve guessed it – Brexit.

The plotters who tried scandalously to exonerate Owen Paterson and undermine the course of parliamentary justice were all Brexiters – some of them extremely so. From Paterson himself to the prime minister, who attended the dinner where the plot was hatched, taking in the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who enthusiastically supported it, they all share responsibility for what is now being increasingly recognised as the catastrophe of Brexit. For, make no mistake about it, Brexit was, and remains, a sleazy operation.

What is the common factor behind the problems we read about daily, from the crisis in Northern Ireland to the supply chain issues that bedevil normal life in Britain? It is that, thanks to Brexit, we have left the single market.

However, I refer to Great Britain, which does not include Northern Ireland. When we move to the United Kingdom, which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we find that under the “protocol” negotiated by Johnson and his lickspittle Lord Frost, Northern Ireland remained inside the single market. This was always going to cause friction, and we may now be heading for the climax.

But a central feature of the Brexiters’ sleaze operation in the run-up to the 2016 referendum was that we would not leave the single market. In his new book It’s The Leader, Stupid, Andrew Adonis reminds us in a perceptive essay on what he calls Nigel Farage’s “reverse takeover” of the Conservative party that “the Vote Leave: Take Control website explicitly argued that Britain [my italics] would stay in the single market via membership of the European Economic Area, yet leaving the single market became a red line subsequently”.

Recently I have abandoned all caution and raised Brexit with many people I have bumped into, just to get their reaction – of which a typical Brexiter’s one is: 'They didn’t tell us it was going to be like this.'

As we Remainers (and Rejoiners) have discovered to our, and the nation’s, cost, the huge benefits of membership of the single market were simply taken for granted until they began to disappear.

The Leave-Remain controversy has for a time had echoes of the Dreyfus affair in early 20th century France – a divisive issue, best not raised in polite company. But recently I have abandoned all caution and raised it with many people I have bumped into, just to get their reaction – of which a typical Brexiter’s one is: “They didn’t tell us it was going to be like this.”

Which brings us to that sleaziest of misrepresentations, which struck the loudest chord during the Leave campaign: £350m a week for the NHS. As they used to say – and no doubt still do – in school exams: “Compare and contrast.” In this case, compare and contrast that £350m a week with Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)’s estimate that the blow to the UK’s long-run productivity from Brexit has been mounting towards 4% of gross domestic product annually.

As my fellow commentator Martin Wolf of the Financial Times pointed out last week, that is £80bn a year. Moreover, the OBR’s estimate is regarded as conservative by some thinktanks, which put the annual loss nearer to 6%, or well over £100bn. By contrast, the “benefits” to the NHS of £350m a week would have amounted to £18bn a year – and they were always mythical anyway.

Now, in common with many, I have been disappointed, to put it mildly, with the Labour party’s poor performance over Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer has been in his element attacking parliamentary sleaze, but this slogan “Make Brexit Work” is surely doomed – unless it is some “cunning plan”, as popularised in the Blackadder television series. Maybe the plan is to capitalise when it becomes obvious to all that Brexit isn’t working and, furthermore, cannot work.

Our future, both economically and politically, lies in Europe, and what we are being subjected to at present is a dangerous historical aberration. Luckily, there is a body called European Movement UK, which is doing its best to rebuild relations with continental Europe step by step: its projects range from alleviating the problems in road haulage and farming to trying to restore visa-free travel for musicians.

Meanwhile, the damage mounts, one of the principal reasons being a collapse of some 15% in our exports to and imports from our principal market. Our prime minister fancies himself as a classical scholar. I wonder if he recalls Aristotle’s observation that “one of the most important subjects about which all men deliberate” is “imports and exports”?

He should certainly be aware of Aristotle’s insights into the “fatal flaw” in leaders’ characters: hubris, or arrogance. Johnson has been displaying this in spades.",the plotters who tried scandalously to exonerate Owen Paterson were all Brexiters. a central feature of the Brexiters’ sleaze operation in the run-up to the 2016 referendum was that we would not leave the single market.

The BBC has reported that Scottish unionist funding organisation Constitutional Research Council (CRC) has been fined £6,000 for failing to report the donation.

It was a record fine by the Electoral Commission.

However the commission accepted that the donation and its donors were permissible.

CRC is chaired by Scottish Conservative Richard Cook, but the identities of those who made donations to the party remain unknown.

Following an investigation, the Electoral Commission ruled that there was ""no reasonable excuse"" for failing to report it, along with other political contributions and gifts received.

The DUP received the donation during the Brexit referendum campaign and spent £282,000 of the money on an advert in the Metro newspaper.

A BBC NI Spotlight programme asked questions about whether the DUP incurred joint spending with other EU referendum campaigners but did not declare it under a common plan.

Under Electoral Commission rules, groups are not allowed to work together in order to get around funding limits.

The DUP has denied wrongdoing and insisted it acted within electoral law. It said yesterday that it had nothing to add to previous comments on the matter.

Following the airing of the documentary in June, the Electoral Commission requested further evidence from BBC NI but were told there was no other significant information other than what was in the programme.

In August, the Electoral Commission announced that there were ""no grounds"" for an investigation into the issue.

Details of the fine were contained in new correspondence from the Electoral Commission released by the Good Law Project, the BBC reported.

The group had been seeking a judicial review over the commission's refusal not to probe the allegations made on Spotlight.","a pro-brexit group has been fined £6,000 for failing to report a £435,000 donation. the Electoral Commission ruled there was ""no reasonable excuse"" for the fine. the group received the donation during the referendum campaign and spent £282,000."

Brexit, according to the latest edition of Wetherspoon News, is a route to “democracy and free trade”, to “equal freedom and prosperity”.

Following an appraisal of the implications of a no-deal Brexit, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin has informed attentive Fosters drinkers across the country that Britain crashing out of the EU would be no greater trouble than his company’s triumphant substitution of German Jägermeister with English Strika. Any other spin, he claims, is “just another pro-EU shaggy dog story” desperately cobbled together by a “metropolitan elite”. You’re even invited to his once-in-a-lifetime countrywide Brexit tour were any of your doubts to persist.

Cards on the table. I’m a left-wing, London-based Remainer. I’m presumably a self-elected member of this “metropolitan elite” in Martin’s eyes. But that is rather hard to square with the poverty wages he pays me to work the bar at one of his central London pubs.

Like a lot of hospitality jobs, work at Wetherspoons is, in my opinion, underpaid and undervalued. It’s an intense and stressful job – preparing drinks and food and unclogging toilets for hours on end. Our breaks are short and unpaid. Zero-hour contracts are open to abuse by managers who have no obligation to give us enough work to survive on. Being sick means either working through the flu or losing a day’s pay and, once a set number of “trigger” days is hit, perhaps your job too.

We work unsocial hours, rarely seeing friends, but are continuously confronted with drunk, abusive and sometimes violent customers who’ll mindlessly dehumanise you into a mechanical pint pourer. You might say this is just the price you pay for working in a pub, and I am grateful to have a job of any sort, but it is also, I think, a depressing vision of how crude, mercantile Brexiteers like Martin see the world.

In October, two Wetherspoon outlets in Brighton joined a series of hospitality strikes in demand of union recognition and a £10 hourly wage. It’s a fight that needs expanding across the country. But the choice most employees see is to put up with the conditions or leave; and with staff turnover so absurdly high, most seem to go for the latter.

It appears Wetherspoons has been doing rather well out of our working conditions. Last year the company pulled in £89m in pre-tax profits; and Martin himself has accrued a tidy estimated net wealth of almost £500m. As a full-time bar associate in central London I might put through £4,000 in weekly sales – and receive less than a tenth of that in my wages. The irony is that if Brexit leads to rising staff costs, as it well might, then the Martin model looks fragile. Today he revealed he expects profits to fall despite rising sales.

While I work long hours for meagre rewards, I believe Tim Martin is exploiting his position at the head of a huge high-profile company to advocate for a Brexit which threatens to make working conditions worse, never mind the evidence that the Brexit debate has already led to a surge in racist and queerphobic hate crimes.

The financial crisis and a Conservative government have combined to slash away at our public services. I fear that the kind of no-deal Brexit my boss advocates promises to accelerate austerity to rates we might have previously deluded ourselves were unthinkable.

There is a conspicuous absence from Martin’s propaganda of the implications for the migrant workers who keep his company running. With Tories celebrating the end of free movement, and Labour failing to stand up for it, it’s essentially guaranteed that any Brexit will lead to the greatest expansion of border controls in generations.

A large proportion of Wetherspoons’ 30,000+ staff are EU nationals and yet Martin himself appears to be utterly incoherent on the issue of migrant workers’ rights. In one breath, he salutes EU citizens’ contributions to the UK’s social, cultural and economic life, and in the next he pontificates in favour of an Australia-style “points system” that prioritises the kind of “skilled” and “professional” work that, if enacted, would attack the right of his own employees to even work here.

It is nothing short of perverse that it’s the organisation’s bar associates – the lowest-paid and most migrant-heavy layer of the workforce – who are responsible for distributing Martin’s politics in pubs up and down the country. Through content in the magazine, on leaflets and even on beer mats, we are essentially instructed to propagandise for a policy that promises to make our livelihoods more precarious.

Brexit has always been driven by the central xenophobic lie that blames the decline of living standards on foreign workers. Yet when you contrast the extreme wealth of Wetherspoon’s shareholders with what I see as poverty wages granted to all its employees, it’s all too clear in my mind that it’s not migrants who drive down wages, it’s exploitative bosses.

I’m opposed to Brexit because I’ve no time for racist lies or those willing to triangulate around them. Low-paid hourly workers depend on our public services more than anyone else in society, but ending freedom of movement will not bring one single child out of poverty.

That’s to say nothing of the millions of EU nationals – including thousands of my fellow workers – who face uncertainty, at best, and deportation at worst. And there’s the theft of the rights we all face, to live and study and love and work in a world far greater than the tiny patch of land into which we were born.

I want a society that’s run in the interests of the people who keep it running – and that’s as true for Wetherspoons as for the country at large. We need all employers to be mandated to pay a real living wage, we need workplace democracy, and we need a tax system which targets those who can best afford it – like Tim Martin – to fund health, education and childcare. It is utterly maddening that my boss uses his workers to spread a parade of facile soundbites that go against all of this to a captive audience of Wetherspoons drinkers.

Brexit is already costing the UK’s public finances £17bn a year, according to a detailed study released ahead of critical votes in parliament this week.

The amount would be sufficient to pay 10,000 more police to patrol the streets and train nurses to fill every vacancy in England, and still leave enough to cover the UK’s current contribution to the EU’s budget.

The research from the Centre for European Reform estimates the UK economy is 2.3 per cent smaller than it would have been had Britain voted to remain in the EU back in 2016.

The think tank calculated that the reduced GDP would limit the Treasury’s spending power by £17bn a year, or £320m per week – around the amount promised for the NHS by the Leave campaign on the side of its touring bus.

On Tuesday MPs will attempt to break the Brexit deadlock in a series of votes that could hand parliament more power to control the next phase of Brexit, though the signs are that the impasse and uncertainty may go on for weeks.

But the CER’s research indicates that whatever route is chosen, Brexit has already taken a heavy toll on the British economy.

Deputy director John Springford said: “Britain’s decision to leave the EU damaged growth, largely thanks to higher inflation and lower business investment.

“The UK missed out on a broad-based upturn in growth among advanced economies in 2017 and early 2018. And the economic cost of the decision so far is sizeable, if not disastrous.”

(CER (CER)

The CER’s most up-to-date analysis, passed to The Independent, used a computer programme to create a “doppleganger” UK economy which it then tracked from 2009 until today.

The doppleganger closely matched the real UK economy until the referendum in 2016, when the two countries’ economic performance diverged – with the real UK’s GDP 2.3 per cent lower by the third quarter of 2018.

The analysis found that 1 per cent of lost GDP resulted in £7.6bn of extra borrowing. Given that there is no discernible “Brexit dividend” yet, it means that for the real UK’s 2.3 per cent loss in GDP, there is a hit to the public finances of £17bn a year.

Critically, it also implies that the UK’s fiscal deficit would have largely been eliminated in the 2018-19 financial year if Britain had voted to remain in the EU.

Mr Springford said: “The CER will continue to update our model as new quarterly GDP data comes in – and as a result, we will have a decent basis to test the claims made by Leave and Remain. So far, ‘Project Fear’ continues to be closer to the truth.”

Data released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this week pointed to a need for more resourcing for public services, as it showed violent crime recorded in England and Wales has risen by 19 per cent in a year, amid plummeting police numbers.

An average salary for a new police constable is just under £31,000, add some £12,000 for recruitment and training, and the cost of 10,000 new officers reaches £430m.

With the cost of training one nurse at around £70,000 and a starting salary of some £25,000, it would cost £3.8bn to fill all 40,000 vacancies in England.

Yet even after taking on the substantial costs of restaffing police forces and hospitals, the CER research indicates that had the UK voted Remain there would still be several billion pounds left for the chancellor to play with this year – even after paying off the UK’s £8.9bn net annual contribution to the EU.

The CER’s data could have deep implications for how MPs vote in a series of critical divisions on Tuesday, when parliament will take decisions on several different proposals for what to do next.

Some plans being put forward by MPs would extend the Article 50 negotiating period, others would give more power to parliament to direct the government’s next steps, with the prospect of a second referendum further down the line.

In the meantime Theresa May is planning to return to the European Union in an attempt to secure new concessions on the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with Brussels, to make the deal more palatable to her Conservative MPs.","research from the centre for european reform estimates the UK economy is 2.3 per cent smaller than it would have been had Britain voted to remain in the EU back in 2016. the reduced GDP would limit the Treasury’s spending power by £17bn a year, or £320m per week."

It’s hard to put what’s happening to Britain into words. Genuinely so. The sheer scale and scope of the disaster that’s unfolding beggars belief — and reduces even seasoned observers like me, of the mistakes societies make, to speechlessness. How, for example, do you begin to comment on stories like these?

An A&E patient was forced to wait for ’99 hours’ before receiving a bed last week and parents have told how their ailing children were forced to sleep on chairs as the NHS faces a worsening crisis this winter. The unnamed patient was brought to Swindon’s Great Western Hospital by ambulance last week but was left waiting on a gurney for four days while staff urgently tried to source an available bed. One clinician at Great Western Hospital told the Sunday Times: ‘We’re broken and nobody is listening,’

Even telling the story that way doesn’t do it justice. Let me put it even more bluntly. Some poor soul went to the ER, and things were so broken, that they had to wait over a week — in chairs, on gurneys — for a hospital bed. Imagine that being your mom, dad, child, spouse. Just…imagine it.

But that poor patient was one of the lucky ones. Here’s another story:

Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), said hundreds of patients are dying while they wait in overpacked emergency wards. He told Times Radio: ‘We think somewhere between 300 and 500 people are dying as a consequence of delays and problems with urgent and emergency care each week.’

Did you get that? The President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine — Britain’s most senior ER figure — says that 500 people a week are dying because they can’t get care. Beds, ambulances, seen by doctors. Adjusted for populations, that’s nearly a 9/11 every week.

It’s that level of horrific disaster and very real suffering and death. This is shocking. It is flatly crazy.

For this to happen in an erstwhile rich, developed country. A 9/11 every week? Of people dying because they can’t get emergency care? What is even happening here?

But this story isn’t just about Britain’s once-famed NHS, now a broken, dying, mortally wounded thing itself. It’s about how Britain got here. And to tell you that story, we need to begin again, in a different place. The world of cold, hard statistics. My world, as an economist.

In that world, there are statistics, and then there are statistics. The kind that take your breath away, because they contain whole decades, millions upon millions of lives in them, hold the fates of entire nations in their hands. Let me give you one such statistic.

The Centre for Economic Performance @CEP_LSE reckons Brexit has caused UK GDP to be 6.3% to 9.5% lower than it would otherwise have been, while @CER_EU says the shortfall is more like 11%.

Brexit made the UK economy about 10% smaller than it would have been otherwise. That might not sound like a Big Deal to you, but it’s going to be, as I teach you just the smallest bit of economic history. What does losing 10% of an economy really mean?

Let’s put that in perspective, with the simplest economic fact there is. “Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%.” Got that? Britain is already 2/3 of the way to…The Great Depression.

In my world? The world of economics? It doesn’t get worse than that. Words, again, fail. It’s hard to even find an analogue. For a nation which until a few short years ago was the envy of the world — right up until perhaps 2010 or so — but then decided to basically inflict the Great Depression on itself. And no, that’s not hyperbole. Sadly — tragically — idiotically, it’s a fact.

This has never happened before in modern economic history.

Let me say that again, because, like I said, words are failing me, and that’s what Britain’s lunatics want — for all this to go unnoticed and uncommented upon, so that, in an Orwellian twist, it might as well have never really happened.

This has never happened before in modern history. We have never seen anything — anything — remotely like these shocking, incredible, mind-blowing numbers. Happen to a rich country. Happen because a rich country inflicted them on itself.

The only analogues we have for “shocks” to GDP of this magnitude? They’re a) the Great Depression. Or Latin American countries, like Argentina — where GDP fell by 10% in the most severe years of its currency crisis, and that was because it was unable to repay debts denominated in dollars. If that makes your eyes glaze over, don’t worry about it — the point is that the only other place we’ve seen economic shocks of this magnitude are…almost nowhere ever, period.

To an economist like me? It’s like watching someone who was in perfect health, until last week, come in, and now, just a few days later, they have a case of cancer so advanced that there are tumors all over the body, and they’re going into organ failure. Never seen anything like it. Beggars belief. Shouldn’t happen. Shouldn’t even be possible.

Apologies if all this sounds hyperbolic, but a serious point needs to be made here, with words like “shocking” and “unparalleled” and “unprecedented,” which in this case, are absolutely necessary. This is unreal. And until it’s commented on in these terms, Britain itself isn’t going to understand the gravity of the crisis it now finds itself in. It has become the rich world’s Argentina, and that’s not exaggeration. It has plunged itself into something that’s already 2/3 of the way to the Great Depression, and that’s not overstating the case at all, it’s an empirical fact.

Worse, nobody has ever seen anything like what Brexit has done to Britain before, because it’s never happened. The only way I can even attempt to put it into perspective is to use episodes like the Great Depression. Why is that? Well, for example, in America, every slowdown in GDP since the Great Depression has been maybe 2–3%. Even when Covid first broke out, the economy slowed by double digits…for two months. But Brexit is forever.

I have to reach for outlandish comparisons like the Great Depression and Argentina because there aren’t any others that even begin to compare.

So the scale and scope of this self-made disaster is…mind-boggling. Britain’s closest cousin used to be America. But in the last almost century of American history, nothing, and I mean nothing, no natural disaster, no terrorist attack, no garden-variety mistake, no disease, no cyclical slowdown, has caused anything even remotely close to the magnitude of Brexit. Nothing. Earthquakes, hurricanes, 9/11, Trump, nothing. Brexit is in its own category of ruin, by a very long way. Nothing, and I mean nothing, apart from The Great Depression or becoming a poor country, put in perspective how serious and grave and catastrophic it really is.

Now. Brits might have made a terrible mistake, but they aren’t fools. They are beginning to realize, to their horror, that Brexit has been a calamity of historic proportions. That’s not because anyone’s telling them the straight facts above, because they’ve got some kind of theoretical knowledge about it, but more simply, because they’re living it. Hence, in the latest polls, 2/3s of Brits want another referendum, on rejoining the EU again.

That’s because they are beginning to see what “Brexit is already 2/3 of the way to the Great Depression” or “Brexit turned Britain into Argentina” really means.

They can see it means absolutely ruinous things, like emergency room patients waiting 99 hours — over a week — for a hospital bed. Or 500 people a week dying because they can’t get ambulances. Britain’s once famed high streets shuttered. Its economy decimated. The average Brit can very much see that their living standards have gone into absolute free-fall.

You see, “your economy’s now 10% smaller” is just an abstraction. What it means at the everyday level is things, though, that everyone can understand, because, well, they’re terrifying forms of social collapse. Don’t bother calling an ambulance, because chances are, one is never going to show up. Need healthcare? Take care of yourself — now it’s DIY time. Jobs? LOL, good luck with those. Paying the bills? Everyone’s now dipping into their meagre savings. Living standards are going into free-fall, in a way we have never seen in a modern, advanced society.

This is the worst case scenario, but even worse. You see, we economists — the good ones, at least, who aren’t biased by political partisanship — estimated that Brexit would hit the economy to about 10%. That’s already happened, and it’s just barely a year and some after Brexit really went into effect. We have never, ever seen a slide like this — it can only be called a collapse. Precisely because even most economists making that prediction thought the 10% hit would take a decade. Few thought it’d happen in a year or two.

But it has, and that’s how fast and hard Britain is falling apart. It’s why nothing works. It’s why people can’t get healthcare, feed their kids, save, afford their mortgages — why a shocking plunge into Neo-Dickensian impoverishment is now unfolding at a social scale. It’s not just about “the poor” — this time, it’s about the middle and working class, falling into shocking levels of poverty, because of course, that’s what living standards plunging in two years to levels predicted to take ten really means.

The stories, too, of all that abound. Elderly people shivering and freezing, kids who can’t afford lunch, families who can’t afford food, and so forth. Americans, to some extent, are the only ones in the rich world who tolerate such levels of privation — but even Americans aren’t falling into the kind of Dickensian poverty that Britain is. The stories are endless, and they’re horrifying.

But the tales of woe aren’t the real horror story here. The real horror story is that both sides of British politics refuse to admit Brexit was a mistake.

Let me say it again. Both sides. The Labour Party — which was once the world’s most progressive party, once its most innovative and forward-thinking political institution — now… backs Brexit. And so, of course, do the conservatives who made it their crusade. But now that I’ve put it in context for you, you should understand what that really means, and a certain sense of horror should chill you, right in the gut. What “both sides in British politics back Brexit,” at this juncture, means, is that both sides back a Great Depression, or turning Britain into a poor country, because that is what’s already happening, at light-speed, with the shocking fury and pace of an avalanche.

But what do you do when both sides..are on the side…of self-made calamity?

In the midst of all this, the British government’s response has been truly shocking. So shocking that it’s been noted with utter amazement and bafflement around the capitals of the world’s great democracies, dropping jaws from K St to Paris’s 8th Arrondissement to Brussels. Most of the time, the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has a weird grin plastered on his face. One that’s totally, completely, shockingly inappropriate. My man! People in your country can’t get ambulances. Hospital beds. Antibiotics. They can’t feed their kids or afford heat. What are you grinning at?

But when he’s not grinning, he says, shrugging, that these problems “won’t go away.” Wait, what? They won’t go away? It’s your job to do something about it! What planet is Britain on, every single figure in the halls of the world’s great democracies is wondering. How does a Prime Minister just grin — and then shrug — as his nation collapses?

What the?

And yet this is where Britain is. You see, its leaders are grinning and shrugging because this was the point. The point of Brexit wasn’t really just to break up with the EU — it was to turn Britain into a playground for the theories of the furthest, most fanatical, most deluded reaches of the American right. Rishi Sunak isn’t a politician, really — he’s a Stanford MBA. Imagine that America was governed by…a Stanford MBA. LOL, shudder. Imagine France was. Canada. Germany. Impossible, right?

The vision that Britain’s leaders have is now basically an American fairy tale — a libertarian one. Sunak’s grinning — grinning — while the NHS collapses, which means people can’t get medicine, hospital beds, ambulances, and they die…because to the way of thinking of someone who’s a true believer in ultra hard American right wing economics — the kind they teach religiously at Stanford…there’s not supposed to be an NHS. There aren’t supposed to be any public goods at all.

Public transport? Get real! Buy a Tesla — they love those at Stanford. Public media? Get a clue, hey, just use Twitter, so what if it’s full of disinformation and hate and bigotry spread by fascists — what do you think, having a BBC was better? Healthcare and medicine for all? No, no, my friend — to ensure that the strong survive and the weak perish is the moral duty of a society, and anything that gets in the way of that is, well, immoral, not to mention unproductive and inefficient.

The entire idea is that Britain should have be Americanized, have an American style social contract, which is to say, not much of one. But there’s a big difference between Brits and Americans, and that’s money. America’s average income is over twice Britain’s, and that means Americans can make up for that lack of public goods. Brits? LOL. The average Brit has just $500 in their bank account. Good luck affording American style healthcare. Transport. Media. Education. Food. Anything. Hence, the insane, staggering plunge into poverty.

But it doesn’t matter, because the delusional fairy tale is the plan. Sunak’s grin? It’s the smile of the true believer. The one of True Faith. Of Absolute Piety and Wholehearted Belief. Salvation is almost here. Heaven is surely going to arrive. All this? These are just the tribulations that test the pious and faithful, and separate them from the weak. This calamity? It’s a great ritual cleansing, which prepares the way for salvation.

This salvational thinking — and it’s smile of pity at those who are repelled by, say, human sacrifice and slaughter to the gods of fairy tales — is the stuff of cults, fundamentalists, fanatics, extremists, lunatics. It isn’t the stuff of the leaders of modern countries. To put it in context, can you imagine…Justin Trudeau…Emanuel Macron…Joe Biden…grinning like a goddamned religious whackjob…and then telling people that a Great Tribulation was to come, but it’d be good for them…and then shrugging and walking away from the podium? Those nations would all go up in manias of disbelief within hours. That’s how odd, unhinged, creepy, insane all this is really is.

Brits aren’t there yet, because they don’t see it. Nobody much is telling them how bad Brexit really is. 2/3rds of them have already turned against it because they’re living it, but they’re still not quite as appalled as they should be, because, well, in Britain, you still can’t talk much about Brexit. You can live it, experience the grinding poverty, know that something has gone badly wrong. But if someone like me comes along, and points out reality? Which is that, literally, the only comparisons we have for such calamity are the Great Depression and nations like Argentina imploding into poverty?

Well, I certainly won’t invited back on the BBC anytime soon. We all know that, because the fanatical exponents of Brexit are invited back, forever, and that’s despite saying things like they’d rather be Andrew Tate…who’s detained for rape and human trafficking…than Greta Thunberg. That’s how off-the-charts right-wing Britains is made to be socioculturally, how little dissent is allowed, how much the God of Brexit must be worshipped. Fanatics who think of sex abusers as wonderful people are legitimized and lionized just because…they back Brexit. And nobody who doesn’t gets a minute, second, sentence, phrase in to point out reality.

Orwell smiles wickedly. Maybe he knew this day would always come. Maybe, from his little house in Kentish Town, his ghost watches, and grimaces. Or maybe he’s just dead and gone. Like the Britain that once was. A modern, sophisticated, wise, prosperous nation, that used to be the envy of the world. And then became something like its greatest cautionary tale, instead, one of such scale and scope, that everyday words could barely even begin to really its story of ruin, despair, suffering, and collapse.

France, Italy, Germany and Belgium have all banned flights and ferries from the UK into their countries, in an attempt to prevent the spread of toxic nationalist right-wing populist ideology, and also the Coronavirus.

Simon Williams, from Dover, was stunned by the news. “They, they just can’t DO that!” he stuttered, turning a new and deeper hue of gammon.

“Nigel Farage told us that being in the EU meant we couldn’t control our own borders and yet those countries are part of the EU, and have only gone and bloody controlled their own borders – just like THAT!

“Surely that wasn’t all a lie to get us to vote for an economically catastrophic break from our largest trading partner just to line the pockets of disaster capitalists like him… was it?”

One French citizen, Christophe James, told us – after he had stopped laughing – “Oui, it turned out to be remarkably easy to control our border. We just, you know, said ‘Let’s shut the border with plague island’ and within a few hours the restrictions were in place.

“After all, what does Britain have to offer us at the moment apart from lengthy delays at the border crossing and a new and more virulent strain of COVID-19?”

According to reports, a number of builders were seen this morning bricking up the Channel Tunnel from the Calais end.","France, Italy, Germany and Belgium have all banned flights and ferries from the UK into their countries. a number of builders were seen this morning bricking up the channel tunnel from the Calais end."

The plan was to sample the mood of the kind of place once considered to hold the key to British elections: remember “Worcester woman”, the swing-voting stereotype talked up in the New Labour years? But I was also there to gather more evidence of how much the UK’s current woes are affecting the kind of average-to-affluent places that might once have weathered any economic storm.

Not entirely surprisingly, people said they were worried and scared. Some talked about grownup children suddenly terrified that a mortgage is beyond their reach; others described a new and unsettling habit of using sparing amounts of gas and electricity. The autumn’s increasingly awful mood music – from talk of cancelled local Christmas markets to the possibility of three-hour power cuts – informed just about every conversation I had.

Mention of politics drew some very interesting responses indeed. “I just miss Boris,” said Julie, who works at the city-centre branch of Boots, and told me she had long since got used to conversations with her customers about the impossibility of their living costs. As she and a few other people saw it, Johnson had successfully managed the Covid vaccination programme, and brought some pizzazz and humour to the boring world of politics, which had now reverted to type. They also voiced something I have heard a few times lately: a belief that he had represented the last hope of Brexit somehow opening the way to a happier and more prosperous country, a dream that died when he left Downing Street.

Clearly, that is a very generous opinion of a man who told just as many self-serving lies about leaving the EU as he did about most other things. At the heart of some lingering fondness for him, perhaps, is a lot of people’s refusal to admit how much they were duped. But that view of life before and after Johnson highlights something that is now settling among all but the most hardened Brexit supporters: a quiet, slightly tortured realisation that all those optimistic visions of life outside the EU are not going to materialise, even if the crises triggered by Vladimir Putin eventually subside.

British people being British people, this is not yet a matter of any widespread anger. Though they probably ought to, no one is about to charge into the streets and demand any kind of Brexit reckoning. But if you want to understand the current political moment – and some of the reasons why the Conservatives have so suddenly and spectacularly imploded – here is a strangely overlooked part of the story.

Whoever people blame for our current predicament, one vivid fact is inescapable. The future that 17 million voters bought into six years ago has now collapsed into its precise opposite. In the summer of 2016, let us not forget, Johnson, Michael Gove and the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart jointly put their names to an article in the Sun which insisted that once Brexit happened, “the NHS will be stronger, class sizes smaller and taxes lower. We’ll have more money to spend on our priorities, wages will be higher and fuel bills will be lower.”

A year later, Jacob Rees-Mogg – who still seems to be trying to sniff out undiscovered “Brexit opportunities” – assured anyone who would listen that leaving the EU would open the way to much cheaper food, and therefore increase people’s disposable income. Brexit is not the only thing that has revealed the impossibility of those dreams, but that is not quite the point: making promises like that was both stupid and dangerous, and we are now starting to live with the consequences.

For Liz Truss and her government, post-Brexit politics is proving to be impossible. They want life outside the EU to mean Darwinian economics, public spending cuts and a smaller welfare state – which is not what millions of leave supporters thought they were voting for in the 2016 referendum, nor what the Tories offered in the two elections that followed. Meanwhile, trying to wriggle out of Brexit’s endless constraints in pursuit of growth threatens to tie the government in knots. Suella Braverman, a home secretary who embodies all of modern Conservatism’s nastiness and introversion, says she wants to cut net migration to “tens of thousands”. But Downing Street has been signalling that it wants to liberalise the UK’s immigration system, a move that would definitely send a certain kind of Brexit voter into paroxysms of fury. Everything is a mess because the logic of Truss and her allies’ position cannot hold: as the Brexit revolution that upturned Conservative politics and brought them to power unravels, the reason for their success is also a guarantee of their failure.

Given its longstanding refusal to question our exit from the EU, Keir Starmer’s Labour party faces some comparable contradictions, but seems to be tentatively trying to find a way through. One of the most fascinating moments of the past two weeks of political theatre happened during Starmer’s conference speech in Liverpool, when Starmer actually mentioned the B word, and tentatively talked about what Brexit’s calamities mean for people’s view of politics. Many who voted for Brexit, he said, did so because they wanted “democratic control over their lives … opportunities for the next generation, communities they felt proud of, public services they could rely on”. This was a slightly rose-tinted reading of recent history, but it just about rang true. He added: “Whether you voted leave or remain, you’ve been let down.” His claim that he will somehow make Brexit work still sounds deeply questionable, but this is a start: an acknowledgment, at least, of the lies and cynicism that got us here.

Whether mounting disappointment and resentment will simply mean a neat switch from the Tories to Labour is another matter. The untruths Tony Blair told about the Iraq war eventually played their part in the huge crisis of public trust that led on to Brexit, and the endless political flux that followed it. Now, 2016’s deceits are being revealed in an even more toxic political environment, awash with conspiracy theory and polarisation. Anyone who assumes that a mood of cynicism, fear and dashed hopes will put politics the correct way up ought to maybe think about recent events in Italy, Sweden and France – and, closer to home, that instant nostalgia for the reckless, authoritarian style of leadership that Johnson combined with his more showbiz aspects. Once Truss is out of the way, the ultimate Brexit paradox may yet materialise: a horrific boost for the very kind of politics its failure ought to have killed stone dead.","'worcester woman' was once considered to hold key to britain's elections. but the current woes are affecting the kind of average-to-affluent places that might once have weathered any economic storm.

According to Guardian analysis, the OECD calculates that the UK will record the lowest growth in the G20 next year with the exception of Russia whose economy is being drained by its war on Ukraine.

The Office for Budget Responsibility says Brexit will have a long-term effect of cutting UK GDP by a hefty 4 per cent, an estimate unchanged since early 2020.

The Financial Times says such a decline amounts to £100 billion in lost output, and £40 bilion less revenue to the Treasury a year.

The UK is now behind all the other G7 nations in the pace of its recovery from the pandemic, with exports by UK small businesses to the EU down significantly.

Geoffrey Betts, the managing director of a small office supplies business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, voted to leave the EU in 2016.

“I thought we would be like … ‘here we go, here we go. We are going to become the most competitive country in Europe and we are going to be encouraging business.’

“Now I think: ‘What have we done?’”, he said.

Sales of milk and cream to the EU are down an extraordinary 96 per cent – and chicken and beef by almost 80 per cent – because of Brexit, new figures show.

Overall, the trade barriers erected in Boris Johnson’s deal have cost exporters more than £1.1bn since the start of the year, The Food and Drink Federation says.

The organisation said it was “essential” that the UK urgently restarts talks with the EU to resolve the crisis – something the prime minister has so far refused to do.

The statistics lay bare how withdrawal from the EU – rather than the impact of Covid-19 – lies behind the collapse in exports, since the transition period ended on 31 December.

Food and drink exports to non-EU countries rose by 8.7 per cent, between February 2020 and February 2021, but fell by 40.9 per cent to the EU.

Downing Street has, so far, rebuffed industry calls to reopen negotiations with Brussels, other than to try to resolve the legal crisis surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol.

But Dominic Goudie, the FDF’s head of international trade, said: “Exports to our biggest market, Ireland, have also dropped more than two thirds.

“UK businesses continue to struggle with inconsistent and incorrect demands at EU borders, and small businesses have been hardest hit due to the collapse of groupage distribution into the EU.

“It is essential that the EU-UK partnership council and its trade specialised committees are convened to urgently address problems.”

The FDF said exports to the EU had partially bounced back from a 76 per cent fall in January – but remained 41 per cent down on a year ago. In addition:

* Imports from the EU are down 17 per cent – despite increasing from the rest of the world by nearly 6 per cent.

* Imports of pork, chicken and beef were down more than 30 per cent – and fruit and vegetables by 21 per cent and 13 per cent respectively.

The Brexit trade deal has hit animal – and plant – products hardest, because it failed to include an agreement to avoid form-filling and physical inspections on so-called sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls.

They are already hurting exporters and deliveries to Northern Ireland, a problem set to grow when full Irish Sea checks – and, most crucially, controls on imports from the EU – finally come in.

Last month, a Lords committee warned plant and animal checks would become “a permanent barrier” to trade unless the UK drops its opposition to a different deal.

It rejected Mr Johnson’s claims of “teething problems” – arguing the punishing red tape is here to stay unless agreement can be reached with Brussels on common health and safety standards.","food and drink exports to non-EU countries rose by 8.7% between February 2020 and February 2021, but fell by 40.9 per cent to the EU. sales of milk and cream to the EU are down an extraordinary 96% – and chicken and beef by almost 80 per cent."

As drivers begin to queue outside petrol stations, before going home to their freezing houses, because they can’t afford the heating, senior government officials have insisted today that everything is going completely to plan in the country and Brexit is a roaring success.

A spokesperson for the government revealed, “Yes, things are going great. Just like we said they would.

“I mean obviously food is a LOT more expensive – if you’re lucky enough to find that there is anything left on the shelves – and it’s going to cost an absolute fortune to heat your houses over winter because energy prices are soaring.

“But other than that it’s fine. Apart from the farmers and fishermen of course, who are admittedly struggling a bit, and the hospitality sector which is totally fucked because they can’t get any workers. But at least the NHS is doing great, because of all the extra money they are getting.

Why keep trying?,"And with each change, a posse of junior ministers gets dragged out of the Treasury behind them. Chris Philp: gone as chief secretary. Simon Clarke, his predecessor and Steve Barclay before him: both scattered to lesser offices of state. As for the two chief secretaries before them? One was Sunak, the other Liz Truss herself.

Javid, Sunak, Zahawi, Kwarteng, Hunt… that’s a list of chancellors who’ve been ground up and squeezed out of the political mincing machine since 2019 – the last four of them in just four months.

So what we’re seeing in this crisis is not just the collapse of UK fiscal credibility. It’s the evisceration of a cadre of Tories capable of doing the job.

And there’s an existential reason why. Each of these politicians has tried to make Brexit work and it will not work. Theresa May tried soft Brexit plus austerity. Boris Johnson tried hard Brexit plus fiscal expansion. Truss tried hard Brexit plus fiscal expansion. As I write this, with the helicopters buzzing over a frenzied Whitehall, only the austerity part is certain. Being chancellor is hard.

Being chief secretary is even harder, because you’re the enforcer with your own side: the person whose hand actually signs off public spending, and whose spreadsheets keep the state pension system solvent. So the Tory debacle is systematically scouring out the talent from Britain’s political class.

You can wing it as an amateur at Defra. You can Tweet, like home secretary Suella Braverman, sarky comments against police officers trying to do their jobs. Or, like Boris Johnson while PM, you can simply lie. But in monetary and fiscal policy, command of detail and communicative restraint matter, because you are dealing with immovable reality.

To restore Britain’s fiscal credibility, the Tories will now be required to do the very thing they don’t believe in: raise taxes and most probably cut spending massively – including on policing and defence.

Even as Hunt delivered his total U-turn, the masthead on the Conservative Party Twitter account said “cutting taxes is the right thing to do morally and economically” – a direct quote from Truss herself. Conservatism ended up in this moral and economic space because all its other options for making Brexit work were tried.

Less than four weeks ago the Tufton Street gurus of free-market economics were being hailed as visionaries for designing this “laboratory experiment” in neo-Thatcherism. Now it’s over, how will Tory finance ministers justify to themselves, their advisers, their civil servants, a programme they do not believe in?

The magnitude of the Tory debacle, therefore, does not lie simply in the damage it has done to the public finances, or the damage it will bequeath to a Labour government. It lies in the ideological dead end the party has reached.

The moment has been a long time coming. David Cameron and George Osborne inflicted austerity on a scale that, in its first two years, plunged the economy into stagnation. Only the Bank of England issuing money to the tune of hundreds of billions limited the damage.

Johnson and May, each grappling with the post-Brexit reality of falling trade, flatlining investment, and then Covid-19, ended up borrowing on a massive scale – secure in the knowledge that a country with a sovereign currency cannot go bust, and that all other countries were being forced to borrow.

Rishi Sunak, like the proverbial dieter bingeing on doughnuts, pledged that once the cravings were over, he too would deliver lower taxes and a smaller state – even as he borrowed more in a year than John McDonnell had promised to over five years.

Now the small state is proven a chimera, the Conservatives face a moment of ideological reckoning.

Out of the wreckage of conservatism must now crawl a new cadre of politicians who believe in fiscal realism.

Brexit has created an economy that cannot pay its way. As trade falls on all measures, the current account deficit has ballooned above 8% of GDP. That leaves UK government borrowing reliant – as former Bank governor Mark Carney put it – on “the kindness of strangers”. Growth is stagnant because investment has stagnated since 2016. And though the pound has lost nearly a third of its value since Brexit, the etiolated structure of the economy means there is no upside in terms of exports.

So the strategic choice facing those who will pick up the pieces is not small state/big state. It is the reversal of Brexit – at least to the extent that we begin to attract long-term business investment; and that our current account deficit reverses; and the government’s cost of borrowing comes down to sustainable levels.

What’s striking, as we watch the Tories flounder, is how un-conservative they became. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott once defined the conservative ethos as the ability to “keep afloat on an even keel… seamanship consists in using the resources of a traditional manner of behaviour in order to make a friend of every hostile occasion.”

The traditional manner of behaviour – drilled into every junior official at the Treasury, every economics undergraduate, every nerd in a bow-tie at the Oxford Union – is to balance the country’s books and instil confidence.

Instead – to switch metaphors – a whole generation of Tories in early middle age have leapt over the parapet of the trench to get mown down by the markets. Hopefully we will not see their like again.","each of these politicians has tried to make Brexit work and it will not work. being chancellor is hard. being chief secretary is even harder. to restore Britain’s fiscal credibility, the tories will be required to raise taxes and most probably cut spending massively."

It showed that an average of just under 49 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake, compared to just over 38 per cent who still say it was the right decision, while 13 per cent “don’t know”, according to 211 surveys carried out this year.

The average annual gap between those who believe it was “wrong” to vote to Leave compared to “right” has risen into double digits for the first time in 2022, to 10.6 percentage points.

This is almost double the 5.5 percentage point gap of last year, and far higher than 6.4 percentage points in 2020 and just under seven points in 2019, according to the analysis of 211 polls which asked whether in hindsight people thought Britain was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU.

The latest figures also compare to the 52 to 48 Brexit referendum result in 2016 for Britain to quit the European Union.

The findings came as the Government appears to be trying to avoid making any public assessment of the economic impact of Brexit so far since the country voted to Leave six years ago.

Brexit minister Jacob Rees-Mogg recently refused to say if the Government had carried out any such studies and if so what they had revealed, and suggested other assessments were “bilge”.

But Labour MP Hilary Benn, co-convenor of the UK Trade and Business Commission, said: “It’s (Brexit) made life more difficult for British businesses trying to sell to Europe because it’s dumped a whole lot of cost, bureaucracy and red tape onto them.

“But a decision was made and the question now is how do we build a new and different relationship with our European neighbours.”

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat business spokeswoman and MP for Richmond, said: “The Government’s botched trade deals have drowned our businesses in red tape and increased costs for families.

“Ministers should be working flat out to get our economy moving again.”

Britain’s former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost has admitted quitting the EU may have hit the UK’s goods exports by five per cent but he believes that the country’s “performance is continuing to improve, and this figure may well change further as the figures normalise”.

He also doubts that quitting the EU will have any “measurable impact on our GDP one way or another”.

Patrick English, associate director of political and social research at YouGov, stressed that there had not been any dramatic shift in the country’s view on Brexit over the years.

He said: “Between YouGov’s first polling on this issue and the figures today, there has been only around a 6-point increase in the percentage of people who think Brexit was the ‘wrong’ decision, and a slightly larger, but still small, decrease in the percentage of people who think it was ‘right’.”

He added: “A large proportion of the widening in the wrong vs right gap can be attributed to generational replacement alone, with Brexit supporters far likely to be older and those who supported Remain much younger.

“The relative stability of attitudes reflects how deep the Brexit divide entrenched itself within British politics and public opinion, evolving to become much more of a political identity than a policy preference.”

The Treasury has been largely silent on the impact of Brexit and the Bank of England has been accused of being reluctant to talk about it to avoid upsetting the Government.

But a recent report by The Resolution Foundation, in collaboration with the London School of Economics, warned that Brexit will hit workers’ real wages by around 470-a-year, compared to what it would have been, and damage Britain’s competitiveness.

Another report, by the Centre for European Reform, estimated that the UK was being hit with a £31 billion blow to GDP from Brexit in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Meanwhile, the Government’s bid to effectively tear up parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol cleared its first Commons hurdle, with no Tory MPs voting against it despite warnings that the plans are illegal.

MPs voted 295 to 221, majority 74, to give the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill a Second Reading, which clears the way for it to undergo detailed scrutiny in the coming weeks.

Voting lists showed that dozens of Conservative MPs abstained, joining former Prime Minister Theresa May, who made clear she would not support the legislation as she warned it would “diminish” the UK’s global standing and delivered a withering assessment of its legality and impact.

Following the result, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted the Bill, which gives ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, “provides practical solutions to problems caused by the Protocol and protects the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement”.

“While a negotiated outcome remains our preference - the EU must accept changes to the Protocol itself,” she added.",an average of just under 49 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake. but just over 38 per cent still say it was the right decision. the average annual gap between those who believe it was 'wrong' and 'right' has risen into double digits for the first time in 2022.

Brexit is “largely to blame” for billions being lost in trade and tax revenues in recent years, according to a new study by top economists.

The Centre for European Reform (CEF) said that by the end of last year, Britain’s economy was 5.2 per cent – or £31bn – smaller than it would have been without Brexit and the Covid pandemic.

“We can’t blame Brexit for all of the 5.2 per cent GDP shortfall … but it’s apparent that Brexit is largely to blame,” said John Springford, author of the CEF study.

The CER modelled the performance of a “doppelganger” UK – if the nation had remained inside the EU’s single market – using data from other advanced economies similar to the UK.

Mr Springford said “disentangling” the economic effects of Brexit and Covid in recent years was “difficult” – but said it was clear that the bigger negative impact had come from Brexit.

The economist argues that a huge gap between the current UK and his “doppelganger” economy had opened up before the pandemic struck in the spring of 2020.

Mr Springford said the sluggish economic performance after the end of lockdowns in 2021 also showed that the “sizeable” shortfall was “mostly Brexit and not Covid”.

“The UK ended Covid restrictions sooner than many of its peers, thanks in part to starting its vaccination campaign early in 2021,” he said. “That should have made its recovery from Covid faster than other countries, not slower.”

The CER study said it was “hard to avoid the conclusion that Brexit has severely curtailed GDP, investment and goods trade”.

The report added: “British politicians may find it difficult to ignore the central role of Brexit in the UK’s economic problems for much longer.”

It comes as British firms point to the post-Brexit red tape which is continuing to create costly hold-ups in trade with the EU.

One seafood firm in Northumberland spoke out about the “ridiculous” paperwork which almost caused a £50,000 delivery to be destroyed, since a form signed 43 times did not include a printed name.

The Coquet Island Shellfish Company told the BBC the issue cost the firm up to £15,000 to sort out after several delays. “There have been no discernible benefits of Brexit. Everything takes longer and costs more,” said sales director Jane Pedersen.

An influential committee of MPs recently warned that it was uncertain whether the post-Brexit free trade agreements negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government will provide any “actual economic benefits”.

No 10 confirmed on Friday that controversial new Brexit legislation – designed to take unilateral action to stop checks agreed with the EU as part of the withdrawal deal – will be published in the Commons on Monday.

Conservative party grandee Ken Clarke said the “vast majority” of peers will back attempts to block the bill and “hold it up for a considerable time”.

Meanwhile, Tory peer David Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, has said he is “thinking” about standing as an MP. “We’ll see if the opportunity arises and it might and it might not, we’ll see,” he told LBC. “I am thinking about it.”

France’s minister for European affairs says she has named her cat “Brexit” on account of its indecisive nature.

Nathalie Loiseau told Le Journal du Dimanche that her pet meows loudly to be let out each morning, but then refuses to go outside when she opens the door.

The comments from the French government’s lead in Brexit talks come ahead of a decision by EU leaders on whether to extend the Brexit negotiating period at the request of the UK. And this week will see a possible third rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal by the House of Commons.

“He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out, and then when I open the door he stays put, undecided, and then glares at me when I put him out,” Ms Loiseau said.

Ms Loiseau is set to be the top candidate for Emmanuel Macron’s party in the upcoming European Parliament elections, where she will go head-to-head with Marine Le Pen, who is hoping to lead a far-right insurgency.

The minister has taken a tough and sometimes provocative line in Brexit negotiations so far, proactively shooting down UK proposals and warning of the risks of a no-deal Brexit.

In October she controversially suggested that a no-deal Brexit would be better than Theresa May’s Chequers proposals for the EU, taunting the prime minister her own phrase: “No deal would be better than a bad deal”.

Her approach has echoed the tone set by her president Emmanuel Macron, who has warned he could block an Article 50 extension if the UK does not come up with new choices to justify it.

The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has taken a minister tone, asking: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.”

Almost two years since Britain left the EU on 31 December 2020, YouGov data shows support for Brexit is at a record low, with only 32% of the British public saying it was right to vote to leave and 56% saying it was wrong to leave.

YouGov has been regularly asking the public whether they think it was right or wrong to have voted to leave the EU since shortly after the 2016 referendum. Early polling revealed that more people believed that Brexit was the right decision than not up until the 2017 general election.

Since then, with the exception of very brief periods in April 2020 and April 2021, public opinion has swung in the other direction and the latest results show the gap is at its largest yet, with those who think it was wrong to leave 24 points ahead of people saying it was right.

How do Brexiteers feel six years after voting Leave?

This month, former environment secretary George Eustice told a Commons debate that the post-Brexit trade deal with Australia was “not actually a very good deal” for Britain and Simon Wolfson, the Brexit-backing chief executive of retailer Next, urged the government to make it easier to allow foreign workers into the country saying this is “not the Brexit I wanted”. But how do Brexiteers feel six years down the line?

Following the 2017 general election the percentage of Brexiteers who believed voting to leave the EU was the right decision fell from 90% to around 80%, briefly rising to the high 80s after the withdrawal agreement was ratified in January 2020. However, since June 2021, that percentage has fallen from 88% down to a record low of 70%, while those who believe it to be the wrong thing to do has risen from 4% to an all-time high of 19%.

Remain voters, however, are more likely to have stood by their decision, with 91% still believing it to be the wrong move to leave the EU and just 5% who believe it to be the right call to leave. With the exception of the brief dip to 80% believing it to be the wrong decision in April 2021 when the EU’s Covid vaccine rollout trailed that of the UK’s, the percentage has remained at the high-80s to 90% mark since 2016.

The survey, of 1,328 British nationals across the continent, showed that if “the public narrative suggests Brexit is done and dusted, it has brought deep transformations to the lives of British citizens in the EU and EEA”, the study’s co-lead, Michaela Benson, said.

“The long tail of Brexit is evident in its continuing impacts both on the way they live their lives, and in its lasting significance for their sense of identity and belonging,” said Benson, a sociology professor at Lancaster University.

The survey, conducted between December 2021 and January 2022, a year after the end of the Brexit transition period, and part of a wider project by Lancaster and Birmingham universities, found 59% of respondents had lived in their country of residence for at least five years and most intended to stay.

But many were angered by their loss of free movement, meaning they can no longer move within the EU for work, or retire to another EU country, and especially worried about being unable to return to the UK with non-British family members in future.

Asked whether their past or future migration plans had been affected by Brexit, 27% of respondents said it had affected them a great deal, and 14% a lot. “Where does one even start?” was the response of one British citizen living in Belgium. “Loss of rights like freedom of movement around the EU and to the UK. With a wife who is an EU citizen, I had to decide whether to move to the relevant EU country or stay in the UK. Family now cannot move back to Britain. Uncertainty.”

Another said: “I moved to France in 2020 in order to protect my right to live and work in France post-Brexit. My migration is 100% a result of Brexit.”

Brexit, and the British government’s handling of the Covid pandemic, strongly affected 80% of respondents’ feelings towards the UK, with responses including “deep shame”, “disappointment”, “a shit show”, “embarrassed to be British”, “shambolic”, and “like watching a house on fire”.

Just over 30% still felt very or extremely emotionally attached to the UK, compared with 75% who said they felt a very or extreme emotional attachment to the EU, and 59% who felt the same in relation to their country of residence.

“For me, one of the most interesting things the survey reveals is this sense of disappointment, shame and anguish over Brexit and the pandemic – and a really quite pronounced expression of European identity,” Benson said.

About two-thirds had changed their legal status since 2016, acquiring residency or citizenship. But nearly half did not have the same status – and therefore the same migration and settlement rights – as some or all of their close family members.

This was a major or significant concern for a large majority of respondents, who said it was affecting their own and their children’s work, career and education, or would do so in the future.

“My wife is a Russian citizen,” said one respondent in Italy. “Her right to live and work depend upon my status under the withdrawal agreement. She fears a potential move to another EU country as her residency rights are totally dependent upon mine.”

Those who felt they may want or need to move back to the UK at some stage felt particularly affected, since non-British partners and other family members coming with them would now be subject to UK domestic immigration controls.

“I have a house in England,” said one respondent, who has lived in the Netherlands for 10 years. “I was going to retire there. It’s now being sold. My wife is Dutch. I do not think she could even relocate back to the UK – despite joint ownership of a house, having lived there for 15 years, being fluent in English and having two dual-nationality kids.”

The loss of EU voting rights was also a big concern, with 46% saying they could no longer vote in European elections or, in most cases, local elections in their country of residence. Roughly 42% were also unable to vote in the UK because they had lived abroad for more than 15 years, although this is expected to change.","survey of 1,328 British nationals reveals profound impact on their lives. many expressed serious concerns over their loss of free movement and voting rights. many were angered by their loss of free movement, meaning they can no longer move within the EU for work, or retire to another EU country."

Pints of Carling and Coors are reportedly unavailable in some branches, as problems associated with a lack of HGV drivers batter businesses across Britain.

The shortages have hit several retailers and restaurant chains. Nando’s saw a shortage of chickens due to a combination of not enough drivers and fewer staff working in meat factories.

Other delays have also impacted McDonald’s, which said last week it had run out of milkshakes and bottled drinks as it prioritised deliveries of other products in the interim.

‘Supply problems’

Supermarkets and suppliers are struggling to meet demand following an exodus of drivers from EU countries after Brexit, who returned to the continent during the pandemic and remained there.

This is coupled with the health crisis bringing DVLA testing centres to a standstill, creating a huge backlog of drivers taking their HGV test.

The UK is believed to be short of 100,000 HGV drivers – and Wetherspoons, owned by vocal Brexit-backer Tim Martin, seems to be paying the price.

A spokesman for the pub chain told Metro: “We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available.

“We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue.’

It appears that #Brexit is screwing over Wetherspoons an' all.

In 2016, Spoons printed 200,000 beer mats urging punters to “take back control”, and Martin has continued to speak out in support of Britain’s divorce from Brussels.

‘Doomsayers’

Earlier this year, he called for the government to increase migration from the EU to deal with a shortage of workers in the hospitality sector – despite campaigning to leave the single market and end freedom of movement.

Martin told The Daily Telegraph: “The UK has a low birth rate. A reasonably liberal immigration system controlled by those we have elected, as distinct from the EU system, would be a plus for the economy and the country.

“America, Australia and Singapore have benefitted for many decades from this approach. Immigration combined with democracy works.”

The Wetherspoons chairman has previously warned that remaining in the EU would spark “significant adverse economic consequences” – and labelled those warning of impending economic damage as “doomsayers”.

Arguing in favour of a no-deal Brexit in 2019, Martin said: “I have argued that the UK – and therefore Wetherspoon – will benefit from a free-trade approach, by avoiding a ‘deal’ which involves the payment of £39bn to the EU.”

He even cut the price of some drinks by 20p, in a stunt to show how Brexit would lower costs for boozers.

Gross domestic product – or GDP – is a measure of the size of the economy.

“In the long term it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic”, Hughes told the broadcaster, hours after the OBR responded to Rishi Sunak’s latest budget by saying it expected inflation to reach 4.4% while warning it could hit “the highest rate seen in the UK for three decades”.

It came as Downing Street vowed to retaliate against France if Paris goes ahead with a “disappointing and disproportionate” threat to impose sanctions in an escalation of a row over fishing boats.

The full impact of Brexit on both businesses and consumers will not be felt until next year with shortages set to worsen in sectors ranging from food to building materials, a leading customs expert has claimed.

Simon Sutcliffe, a partner at tax and advisory firm Blick Rothenberg, believes Government delays in implementing post-Brexit customs laws have “softened the impact” of the UK’s exit from the European Union, and that “things will get worse” when they are finally brought in from January 2022.

Despite leaving the EU on 1 January 2020, the Government has delayed many of the customs laws that were due to come into force last year.

The requirement for pre-notification of arrival in the UK of agri-food imports will be introduced on 1 January 2022 as opposed to the already delayed date of 1 October this year.

The new requirements for Export Health Certificates will now be introduced even later, on 1 July next year.

Controls to protect animals and plants from diseases, pests, or contaminants will also be delayed until 1 July 2022, as will the requirement for Safety and Security declarations on imports.

When these laws, which also include the customs declaration system, are brought in Mr Sutcliffe believes the food and raw material shortages already experienced to some extent – especially in Northern Ireland – will worsen on the mainland with some products disappearing from supermarket shelves for the foreseeable future.

Mr Sutcliffe, who was among the first to predict the truck driver shortage and border issues in Northern Ireland, said: “Once these extra extensions come to an end we’re going to be in a whole world of pain for until importers get to grips with it just like the exporters from the UK to the EU have had to already.

“The cost of the bureaucracy involved will mean many retailers will simply not stock some products from the EU any longer.

If you know your fruit delivery is stuck in a UK port for 10 days waiting to be checked, then you’re not going to bother importing it as it’ll go off before it even reaches the store.

“We’re looking at all kinds of products disappearing from supermarkets, from salami to cheeses, because they will just be too expensive to ship in. While a few boutique delicatessens may stock these products, they will become a more expensive and be harder to find.”

He added that the supermarket shop will also face steep price rises as the cost of importing even basic products such as fresh meat, milk, eggs and vegetables will cost retailers more.

“The retailers will not have much choice but to pass on at least some of the increased costs to the consumer,” said Mr Sutcliffe. “In other words, consumers will have less choice and will have to pay more for their weekly shop.”

A spokesman for No 10 said: “We want businesses to focus on their recovery from the pandemic rather than have to deal with new requirements at the border, which is why we’ve set out a pragmatic new timetable for introducing full border controls.

“Businesses will now have more time to prepare for these controls which will be phased in throughout 2022”","Simon Sutcliffe, a partner at tax and advisory firm Blick Rothenberg, believes Government delays in implementing post-Brexit customs laws have ""softened the impact"" of the UK's exit from the eu. despite leaving the eu on 1 January 2020, the Government has delayed many of the customs laws that were due to come into force last year. the requirement for pre-notification of arrival in the uk of agri-food imports will be introduced on 1 January"

A top pollster revealed that 57% of the UK's population think Brexit was not a good choice, as opposed to 43% who think it was.

The tide in Britain appears to have turned since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

According to a new poll, only 43% of the British population consider that the UK's departure from the European Union was a good decision, while 57% believe it was a mistake.

The numbers, revealed on Wednesday by John Curtice, president of the British Polling Council, represent a significant shift from the 2016 results, when almost 52% of the British electorate voted to leave the EU, sending shockwaves across the globe.

""Brexit is probably today at its lowest level of popularity since June 2016,"" Curtice said during a meeting with journalists on Wednesday.

The pollster noted that the pro-EU trend became more noticeable after Autumn 2021 when a shortage of around 100,000 lorry drivers left many British companies and consumers unable to purchase imported goods.

Back then, analysts had argued that many of these lorry drivers used to be from Eastern Europe but the withdrawal from the single market, which ensures freedom of movement for workers, pushed them to search for better opportunities on the continent.

The ongoing cost-of-living crisis, driven by spiralling inflation and energy prices, has further widened the gap between those who support Brexit and those who regret it, Curtice said, although it is too early to conclude that Britons would actually re-consider the referendum's result.

None of the UK's major political parties has any plans to promote or demand a fresh referendum as the country is still attempting to define its post-Brexit identity.

Curtice noted the left-wing Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, does not seem ready to re-open the debate on EU membership or the common market, fearing the question would scare key voters off.

Labour has seen a surge in support in recent weeks after the resignation of two scandal-hit Conservative Prime Ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, in less than four months.

The appointment of Rishi Sunak, who upon arriving at 10 Downing Street promised to fix Truss's mistakes, has somewhat halted the bleeding, Curtice said.

But the Tories, in power since 2010, still remain 30 points behind Labour in the latest polls.

""No government in power during a financial crisis has survived an election,"" Curtice told reporters. ""They have lost ground because public opinion feels it can no longer trust [the Conservatives] to lead the country.""

The next UK general election is scheduled to be held no later than January 2025.","only 43% of the population consider that the UK's departure from the eu was a good decision. 57% believe it was a mistake, according to a top pollster. the numbers represent a significant shift from the 2016 results."

The national rejoin march on Saturday saw large crowds of people walk from Park Lane to Parliament Square. Marchers from across the UK travelled for hours to attend.

Parliament Square Garden, the last stop on the march, saw a sea of blue and yellow as supporters waved EU flags and carried placards.

Some signs said: “Brexit was never going to work”, “For lower bills #rejoin the EU” and “We voted romaine”.

Nikki Ajibade, a 60-year-old teacher from Warwickshire, was at the march with her sister.

She said: “We feel very strongly that the situation we’re in now, you can trace it back directly to 2016 referendum, which was supposedly an advisory referendum.

“It wasn’t a supermajority result, 52 and 48 is not something that you can just completely upturn and upend the whole country. Look six years on where we are. So we feel very strongly that we need to get a sensible government in place, general election now, because this lot are squabbling like rats in a sack.”

When asked about Boris Johnson potentially throwing his hat in the ring to become prime minister again, Ajibade said: “If they’re thinking that Boris Johnson is the answer, they haven’t understood the question, come on this is just ridiculous.

“It’s an insult to the nation. It is an actual insult to the British people to even mention his name as a possible candidate.

“I’m not worried about Boris Johnson coming in. I’m not worried. I think it would be absolutely brilliant, because then he would be the last nail in the Tory coffin.

“It is a national disgrace, an international laughing stock, that’s what they’ve turned us into.”

The crowd booed as a large digital screen overlooking Parliament Square Garden showed pictures of leave-voting figures such as Johnson, Priti Patel and Nigel Farage.

Oliver Jackson, a 26-year-old warehouse worker from Dorset, said that it was important for politicians to listen to those who wanted to rejoin the EU.

He said: “We need to get our voice heard. And especially during all this chaos, we can’t let this be left out. Honestly, the best way to get the UK back on track is to rejoin, at the very least, the single market and then the EU.

“Brexit has been the slow death that has been bleeding the UK dry for years.”

The crowd also chanted “Tories out” and booed when speakers discussed the prospect of Johnson running to become prime minister again.

Tony Harold, 44, from Poole, who works in the share market, said that Brexit affected him as he has a property in Spain.

He said: “We’ve seen the damage and it’s all been downhill ever since it started.

“Personally, I have a second home in Spain, and I’ve been impacted directly. It puts me very much top of the pile. But I’ve seen the benefits of the EU, and free movement, both myself and other people around me.

“It allows you to come and go as you will and it enriches lives. It makes people better,

it gives more of a life experience and it’s very sad to see that go.”

Joshua Allotey, 57, from Winchester, who works for a local authority, believed the UK would continue to suffer because of having left the EU.

He said: “Leaving was a bad mistake. It’s already cost the UK a lot. And unless we go back, it will carry on costing us … It was driven by ideology and it’s not actually designed to help the UK. We’re better off inside the EU.

Chemicals

His claims appear to be supported, at least in part by Full Fact.

They report that in recent weeks the government has allowed water companies to discharge sewage into rivers due to Brexit disrupting deliveries of water treatment chemicals.

Water companies are required to have a permit to discharge untreated sewage into surface waters or groundwater.

The Environment Agency says that “permits contain conditions that control the quality of the effluent you can discharge”, but that companies may not be able to comply with these conditions if they cannot get water treatment chemicals due to a number of reasons, including the pandemic, supply chain failure and “the UK’s new relationship with the EU.”

It says that if companies run out of supplies and follow the procedure outlined, the “Environment Agency will not normally take enforcement action against you.” It adds that companies must get written agreement from their “Environment Agency water company account manager” before they do so.

They conclude: “So Brexit has been at least cited as a factor which might allow water companies to increase how much sewage they discharge.”

Bathing spots

Environmentalist Julia Hailes was furious in an interview with Sky News, she said: “They are putting pollution in the water at common bathing spots.

“People are literally sitting next to sewage pipes and swimming in the water, and they are getting violently sick like my son.”

Government action

The Government is unlikely to take serious action in the foreseeable future over sewage overflows along the UK coastline, a campaigner has said.

Pollution warnings were put in place across more than 40 beaches and swimming spots in England and Wales earlier this week after heavy rain overwhelmed sewer systems, leading water companies to release sewage into the natural environment.

Alerts were still in place for beaches in Devon, Kent, Lancashire, Cumbria, North Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Essex, Somerset and Norfolk as of Sunday afternoon.

However, Neil Cutts, an activist from Surfers Against Sewage, said he does not have the sense that anyone in the current or the incoming government is prepared to do anything to tackle the issue.

Speaking to Times Radio on Sunday, Mr Cutts said the overflows are happening on almost a weekly basis in some areas like Brighton and Cornwall, and not just when there is heavy rainfall.

Campaigning since 90s

Asked whether anyone in government appears prepared to respond, Mr Cutts said: “Unfortunately, no – not at this time because it’s not a new thing.

“Surfers Against Sewage, by the name, has been campaigning for this since the 90s.

“It’s got slightly better but it’s still not changed and unless there is some quite serious legislation brought in by the Government who is in power, it’s going to continue for the foreseeable future.”

On how water companies respond to Surfers Against Sewage’s calls for investment in the infrastructure, Mr Cutts said: “They tend to not listen, to be honest.

“They tend to hide because they are protected slightly by the Government as well – and a series of governments, not just the one that’s currently in power at the moment.”

Mr Cutts also said they get fined “peanuts” by the regulator Ofwat in comparison to what they make.

And it quickly became clear on the streets of Wolverhampton that is hasn't turned out how some expected when they were sold the Brexit dream by certain politicians. The largely working class city voted heavily for Leave at the referendum, with 62.6% choosing Brexit.

But some residents who spoke to Black Country Live have been left disillusioned with where Britain finds itself in 2023. Wayne Williams, 63, hoped leaving the EU would cut immigration but recent headlines have been dominated with boats continuing to cross the Channel as the Government has struggled to tackle the issue.

Mr Williams said he had lost trust in politicians. ""Why people chose Brexit was to stop immigration,"" he said. ""To be honest it was the only time I voted. It hasn't worked.

""I don't trust politicians. It's all lies. They tell you one thing then do the opposite.

""They said it would pay for the NHS. Another lie. They will tell you anything to get you to vote.""

That infamous pledge to give £350 million a week to the NHS, memorably plastered across the front of a Brexit battle bus, came up a lot on the streets of Wolverhampton.

It goes to show the impact campaign slogans have and how people won't forget if promises aren't followed through. Neil Brittain, 75, from Kidderminster, voted Remain and believes the Vote Leave campaign group lied to the public.

He said: ""We shouldn't have done it. How much was it on the bus? And what state is the NHS in now?

""You need to be bonkers not to think Boris lied. It didn't happen like they told us it would happen.""

Sue Jones, 56, from Low Hill in Wolverhampton, said she trusted what she was told by politicians. ""Everybody said it was a good idea and a lot of people, like me, were sheep. They told us stuff and we believed it,"" she said.

""You see the politicians on the telly and you follow them like sheep and believe what they say. But the country hasn't got that much trade coming in and the NHS is in a terrible state.""

Steve Harvey, 44, didn't vote in the referendum as he had ""mixed feelings"" but says he's witnessed problems caused by Brexit in his catering job. He said: ""It caused a lot of complications. I work in catering.

""It made it awkward to get food. Trying to deal with customers and we haven't got this or that, it's annoying customers. I put it down to Brexit.""

He added: ""I don't vote because I don't think it will make any difference. I work to pay my bills. They're not going to do anything for me.""

But some who voted for Brexit stand by their decision and believe it was the right call. Stuart Alves, 71, from Pendeford, said: ""It was a good idea. I used to run a charity and I have seen what happens in the EU.""

Brexit is set to have cost the UK more than £200 billion in lost economic growth by the end of this year — a figure that almost eclipses the total amount the UK has paid toward the European Union budget over the past 47 years.

According to research by Bloomberg Economics, the cost of the UK's vote to leave has already reached £130 billion, with a further £70 billion likely to be added by the end of 2020.

The analysis, by the economist Dan Hanson, found that business uncertainty had caused the UK's economic growth to lag behind that of other G7 countries since the 2016 vote.

That means the British economy is 3% smaller than it might have been if the UK had not voted to leave the EU.

Figures from the House of Commons Library put the UK's total projected contribution to the EU budget from 1973 to 2020 at £215 billion after adjusting for inflation.

That means the combined cost of Brexit since 2016 is likely to soon eclipse the total cost of the EU's budget payments, which were a central part of the Leave campaign's case for Brexit in the first place.

Business confidence and investment has dipped, and annualized economic growth has fallen to about 1% from 2%.

""As the UK comes to terms with its new trading relationship with the EU and grapples with the productivity challenge that has hindered growth since the financial crisis, the annual cost of Brexit is likely to keep increasing,"" Hanson said.","the cost of the UK's vote to leave the EU has already reached £130 billion. a further £70 billion is likely to be added by the end of 2020, the economist said. business confidence and investment in the UK has dipped significantly since the 2016 vote."

Jeremy Corbyn has unveiled leaked government documents that appear to show Boris Johnson misled the public over the nature of his new Brexit deal with the EU.

Labour says the internal Treasury paper, marked “official sensitive”, warns of new customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit – which the prime minister has claimed would not exist.

Speaking in central London on Friday, Mr Corbyn told journalists: “Today I can reveal further hard evidence that Johnson is deliberately misleading the people”.

He added: “This document is very ominous. There will be other secret reports like this one in every government department that reveal the disastrous impacts of his policies on the safety of the food you eat, on the rights you have at work, on the pollution of the air that we breathe and on the jobs and industries that people work in.

“These reports exist but the government is hiding them from you because in this election the Conservatives want you to vote blind.”

The leaked document, entitled “NI Protocol: Unfettered access to the UK internal market”, appears to be an official analysis of the Northern Ireland protocol, which replaces the Irish border backstop negotiated by Theresa May.

The Labour leader said the confidential report “drives a coach and horses” through Mr Johnson’s promise to the DUP that there will be no border in the Irish Sea under his Brexit plan.

The paper, which has been seen by The Independent, reveals there would be customs declarations and regulatory checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Britain – which Mr Johnson has repeatedly denied.

Checks could be “highly disruptive” to the Northern Ireland economy, where 98 per cent of exporters to Britain are small businesses who will be hit hard by these extra costs, according to the report.

Prices of imported high street goods are likely to rise, which would hit business profits and the retail sector, it added.

Mr Corbyn said: “It is there in black and white. It says there will be customs declarations, absolutely clearly, for trade going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.

“The government cannot rule out regulatory checks, rules of origin checks and animal and public health checks also. For trade going the other way, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there will be all of the above plus potentially damaging tariffs.”

The leaked document seems to confirm in the government’s own words what essentially all trade experts say about the Brexit deal with regard to customs, but which Mr Johnson has continued to deny point-blank when asked in public.

At the start of the election campaign, the prime minister was asked in person by Northern Ireland business leaders whether they would be subject to customs declarations.

“You will absolutely not,” he told them. “If anyone asks you to do that tell them to ring up the prime minister and I’ll direct them to put that form in the bin.”

However, Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, have both previously said that some checks will be necessary on goods travelling across the Irish Sea.

Recommended Johnson accused of tearing up his own Brexit deal

Mr Johnson was challenged over the disparity between the document and his previous claims during a campaign visit in southern England, where a journalist asked him: “Either you don’t know the detail of your policy or you are lying. Which is it?”

He replied: “I know perfectly well that goods going from NI to GB and GB to NI will have no checks. The only checks will be those going via NI into Ireland. Everybody understands that and that’s so we avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.”

Asked what voters should believe, the prime minister said: “They should believe exactly what I say, which is that there will be no checks on goods going from GB to NI or NI to GB, because we are going to come out of the EU whole and entire.

“That’s the objective we secured, which is a vast improvement on the original proposal, which would indeed have carved out Northern Ireland and kept it in the EU for all sorts of purposes.”

Earlier in the campaign, Labour presented separate leaked documents that showed UK negotiators have been repeatedly discussing the NHS with US trade officials, despite claims by Mr Johnson that the NHS is not “on the table” in talks.

A Treasury spokesman said: “We don’t comment on leaked documents.”","Jeremy corbyn has unveiled leaked government documents that appear to show Boris Johnson misled the public over the nature of his new Brexit deal with the EU. labour says the internal Treasury paper, marked ""official sensitive"", warns of new customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit."

Two years after the UK transitioned out of the European Union nearly two-thirds of Britons now support a referendum on rejoining.

A Savanta survey for The Independent also shows that the number of people who oppose another vote has fallen, with less than a quarter of voters now against a referendum.

The UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, but the “transition period” meant it observed Brussels laws and remained in the single market until 31 December 2020.

Since then Britons believe the economy, the UK’s global influence and the ability to control our own borders have all got worse, the survey also shows.

This appears to have contributed to a boost in the numbers who want a future referendum on membership.

The number who say there should be another vote is now 65 per cent, up from 55 per cent at the same point last year, although they are split over the timing.

The most popular options were now, at 22 per cent, and within the next 5 years, 24 per cent, followed by within 6-10 years, 11 per cent. Just 4 per cent thought another vote should be in more than 20 years, while those who said there should never be a second referendum have fallen from 32 to 24 per cent.

Chris Hopkins, from Savanta, said it could be that many overestimated the potential benefits of Brexit.

“It’s hard to imagine being in the EU would solve any of the country’s current economic issues,” he said., “but perceptions matter.”

Ha added that the perception Brexit had made control of our own borders harder was “not the taking back of control that all those who voted Leave were promised”.

‘Getting Brexit done’ was Boris Johnson’s major project (PA)

The survey also found 54 per cent now say Brexit was the wrong decision, up from 46 per cent last year, on the first anniversary of Britain’s exit.

The poll not only suggests that the majority of voters now think leaving the EU has made many things worse, but the percentage who think so has increased in many areas in the last year.

A total of 56 per cent now think leaving the EU has made the economy worse, up from 44 per cent.

Half of Britons think it has made the UK’s ability to control its own borders – a key Brexiteer pledge – worse, up from 43 per cent to 50 per cent.

And the proportion who think it has worsened Britain’s global influence is also now 50 per cent, up from 39 per cent.

The findings come amid a renewed focus on the effects of Brexit.

Last week the British Chambers of Commerce called on the government to look again at how trade with Europe can be improved, two years on from the deal agreed by former prime minister Boris Johnson.

Earlier this month researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) also found that Brexit had added £210 to the average household food bill in the two years to the end of 2021, because of extra red tape.

There are signs even some Brexiteers are becoming frustrated. Former minister George Eustice recently hit the headlines when he criticised a post-Brexit trade deal with Australia, saying it “gave away far too much for far too little in return”.

On the results of the latest poll, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: “It’s no wonder that the British public feel this way, when the Conservatives have gone out of their way to make it harder for smaller businesses to trade with our neighbours, for farmers to sell their produce overseas, and for scientists to cooperate with their counterparts.

""The Conservative government’s decision to erect barriers to trade with our largest trading partner is the last thing we need, not least in this cost of living crisis.”

A government spokesperson said: “We are taking full advantage of the many benefits of Brexit, and are restoring the UK’s status as a sovereign, independent country that determines its own future.

“We have taken back control of our borders, restored domestic control over our law-making and axed numerous pieces of bureaucratic red tape, saving businesses and consumers money across the country.”","two years after the UK transitioned out of the eu nearly two-thirds of Britons now support a referendum on rejoining. the number who say there should be another vote is now 65 per cent, up from 55 per cent at the same point last year."

And a new parliamentary report warned the “blind optimism” shown by Tory ministers could force many small and tenant farmers in England out of business, whilst accusing them of not doing enough to gain farmers’ trust in delivering crucial plans.

Under government plans, farmers are encouraged to free up land for environmental reasons.

Higher prices, worse environment?

But the report warned this would means England will import more of its food, often from countries with poorer environmental standards, making the UK more dependent on food from abroad and making food prices more expensive.

The paper also warned this is likely to lead to farms getting bigger, which will in turn harm the environment, against government hopes.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is intending to match the £2.4 billion worth of subsidies given by the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to UK farmers every year.

But this comes with an intention to cut the amount of direct payments, depending on the size of the land farmed, according to The Independent.

Committee chair and Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said: “We have known we were replacing the CAP since 2016 and still we see no clear plans, objectives or communications with those at the sharp end – farmers – in this multi-billion pound, radical overhaul of the way land is used and, more crucially, food is produced in this country.

“The UK is also already a large net importer of food and we heard in evidence that the ELMS’ vague ambition to ‘maximise the value to society of the landscape’ may in reality mean that increases further.”

Farmers earn better since Brexit, Tory minister insists

Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said the Tories are “falling far short” on help for farmers, with “trade deals that undercut our rural businesses, leaving them exposed and rightly feeling let down”.

He added: “Just this week, the environment secretary tried to dodge responsibility for making sure farmers get a fair deal from major retailers, despite rocketing food and production prices.

“For our country to thrive, we need to see more food grown at home, to a high standard and through sustainable processes – but the government isn’t listening.”

But environment secretary George Eustice said Defra disagreed with many issues presented by the report, and accused it of not including recent developments, whilst arguing UK farmers will be paid better post-Brexit.

That figure has risen from 30% in June 2021 to 45% now.

Seven in ten of those who voted remain feel their daily life is worse, up from half last year – and the proportion of leave voters who say the same has doubled over the same period, from 10 to 22%.

Ipsos UK interviewed 1,023 British adults aged 18-75 online between June 3 and June 25, 2022, online. The polling, New polling with the EU:UK Forum shows that the proportion of Britons who think the UK’s exit from the EU has made their daily life worse has increased. At the same time, the proportion of those who say that Brexit has made their daily lives better has also risen, although they remain a smaller group, 17% say that is true up from one in ten in June 2021. Among remain voters, one in ten now say Brexit has made daily life better (up from 5% in 2021) – while a quarter of leave voters say the same, an increase from 17% a year ago.

Overall, Wales voted to leave the EU, with just five of the 22 council areas voting to stay. You can recap the results here.

The proportion who say it has made no difference has shrunk from half in 2021 to a third now. The poll also shows that Europe and the EU remain viewed as an important partner for the UK. Four in ten identify Europe as the most important relationship for Britain, ahead of the Commonwealth (23%) and United States (15%). And almost eight in ten say it is important for Britain to maintain a close relationship with the EU, including 72% of those who voted to leave the EU.

When asked the priorities for Britain’s relationship with the EU: 33% say improving the trade agreement to make it easier to buy and sell goods and services is a top priority, followed by reducing illegal immigration into Britain and responding to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (both 22%). However, almost half (49%) of the public think it is unlikely that Britain and the EU will work together to achieve a satisfactory outcome on the priorities they think are most important.

What do you think? Let us know in the comments below

The public is especially negative about the level of agreement between the EU and UK on two issues: managing illegal immigration across the English Channel and managing border checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland. On the former, just 22% think EU and UK interests are similar while 43% think they are at odds.

For the latter, one-quarter think interests are in sync and four in ten think they are misaligned. And despite it topping the list of public priorities, there is no clear consensus that EU and UK interests are close on increasing trade between the two – 32% think the interests of the two are broadly the same, but 26% think they are at odds – and another 34% a mix of the two.

However, there is a far greater feeling of agreement on other big issues of the day. In particular, the public is likely to think the EU and UK share interests in preventing and detecting crime and terrorism (54%), dealing with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine (52%) and reducing carbon emissions to reach net zero targets (46%).

Kelly Beaver MBE, CEO of Ipsos UK & Ireland, said: ""This polling highlights public uncertainty about the shape of the UK’s future relationship with Europe. However, while they see potential flashpoints around the Northern Ireland border and illegal immigration they also see clear areas of agreement on supporting Ukraine, preventing crime and terrorism, and taking action to meet net zero pledges. We have also seen a sharp increase in people thinking leaving the EU has had a negative effect on their daily lives. This echoes other polling and we may also be seeing an impact from broader concerns about the rising cost of living"".

Dominic Raab has admitted that the US will be free to charge higher prices for drugs bought by the NHS after Brexit, but insisted the prospect is “hugely unlikely”.

Asked if Washington would be free to “jack up prices”, the foreign secretary replied: “The Americans will take their decisions.”

He then said: “I think it’s hugely unlikely, why would they do that?” Sky News interviewer Adam Boulton responded: “To get more money, that’s why.”

The comments come after documents released by Labour revealed that drug pricing has been discussed by US and UK negotiators in exploratory talks.

Officials from the Department for International Trade had “positive bilaterals” and met with PhRMa, the US pharmaceutical lobbying group, to discuss priorities for a future trade deal.

Mr Raab again insisted that the NHS would not be “on the table for negotiations” in the US-UK trade deal that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is desperate to secure after leaving the EU.

He also believes that Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. EPA Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff. Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable. Expected to give evidence to Congress voluntarily and in secret. Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal The Second Whistleblower The lawyer for the first intelligence whistleblower is also representing a second whistleblower regarding the President's actions. Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump’s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president’s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a “shadow” foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump’s behalf and has called himself a “hero”. AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the “favour” he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had “one or two” phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump’s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn’t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump’s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden’s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Hunter Biden Joe Biden’s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden’s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump’s preoccupations with the Biden’s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a “cover-up of a cover-up”. AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. Gordon Sondland testified that Pompeo was ""in the loop"" and knew what was happening in Ukraine. Pompeo has been criticised for not standing up for diplomats under his command when they were publicly criticised by the president. AFP via Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: “The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.” Getty Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a “parody” of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a “four Pinocchios” rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement.

There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts. Reuters Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal William Taylor The most senior US diplomat in Ukraine and the former ambassador there. As one of the first two witnesses in the public impeachment hearings, Taylor dropped an early bombshell by revealing that one of his staff – later identified as diplomat David Holmes – overheard a phone conversation in which Donald Trump could be heard asking about “investigations” the very day after asking the Ukrainian president to investigate his political enemies. Taylor expressed his concern at reported plans to withhold US aid in return for political smears against Trump’s opponents, saying: “It's one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House. It's another thing, I thought, to leverage security assistance -- security assistance to a country at war, dependent on both the security assistance and the demonstration of support."" Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal George Kent A state department official who appeared alongside William Taylor wearing a bow tie that was later mocked by the president.

Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Marie Yovanovitch One of the most striking witnesses to give evidence at the public hearings, the former US ambassador to Ukraine received a rare round of applause as she left the committee room after testifying. Canadian-born Yovanovitch was attacked on Twitter by Donald Trump while she was actually testifying, giving Democrats the chance to ask her to respond. She said she found the attack “very intimidating”. Trump had already threatened her in his 25 July phone call to the Ukrainian president saying: “She’s going to go through some things.” Yovanovitch said she was “shocked, appalled and devastated” by the threat and by the way she was forced out of her job without explanation. REUTERS Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Alexander Vindman A decorated Iraq War veteran and an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, Lt Col Vindman began his evidence with an eye-catching statement about the freedoms America afforded him and his family to speak truth to power without fear of punishment. One of the few witnesses to have actually listened to Trump’s 25 July call with the Ukrainian president, he said he found the conversation so inappropriate that he was compelled to report it to the White House counsel. Trump later mocked him for wearing his military uniform and insisting on being addressed by his rank. Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Jennifer Williams A state department official acting as a Russia expert for vice-president Mike Pence, Ms Williams also listened in on the 25 July phone call. She testified that she found it “unusual” because it focused on domestic politics in terms of Trump asking a foreign leader to investigate his political opponents. Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Kurt Volker The former special envoy to Ukraine was one of the few people giving evidence who was on the Republican witness list although what he had to say may not have been too helpful to their cause. He dismissed the idea that Joe Biden had done anything corrupt, a theory spun without evidence by the president and his allies. He said that he thought the US should be supporting Ukraine’s reforms and that the scheme to find dirt on Democrats did not serve the national interest. Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Tim Morrison An expert on the National Security Council and another witness on the Republican list. He testified that he did not think the president had done anything illegal but admitted that he feared it would create a political storm if it became public. He said he believed the moving the record of the controversial 25 July phone call to a top security server had been an innocent mistake. Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Gordon Sondland In explosive testimony, one of the men at the centre of the scandal got right to the point in his opening testimony: “Was there a quid pro quo? Yes,” said the US ambassador to the EU who was a prime mover in efforts in Ukraine to link the release of military aid with investigations into the president’s political opponents. He said that everyone knew what was going on, implicating vice-president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo. The effect of his evidence is perhaps best illustrated by the reaction of Mr Trump who went from calling Sondland a “great American” a few weeks earlier to claiming that he barely knew him. AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Laura Cooper A Pentagon official, Cooper said Ukrainian officials knew that US aid was being withheld before it became public knowledge in August – undermining a Republican argument that there can’t have been a quid pro quo between aid and investigations if the Ukrainians didn’t know that aid was being withheld. Getty Images Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal David Hale The third most senior official at the state department. Hale testified about the treatment of Marie Yovanovitch and the smear campaign that culminated in her being recalled from her posting as US ambassador to Ukraine. He said: “I believe that she should have been able to stay at post and continue to do the outstanding work.” EPA Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal Fiona Hill Arguably the most confident and self-possessed of the witnesses in the public hearings phase, the Durham-born former NSC Russia expert began by warning Republicans not to keep repeating Kremlin-backed conspiracy theories. In a distinctive northeastern English accent, Dr Hill went on to describe how she had argued with Gordon Sondland about his interference in Ukraine matters until she realised that while she and her colleagues were focused on national security, Sondland was “being involved in a domestic political errand”. She said: “I did say to him, ‘Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, this is going to blow up’. And here we are.” AP Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal David Holmes The Ukraine-based diplomat described being in a restaurant in Kiev with Gordon Sondland while the latter phoned Donald Trump. Holmes said he could hear the president on the other end of the line – because his voice was so “loud and distinctive” and because Sondland had to hold the phone away from his ear – asking about the “investigations” and whether the Ukrainian president would cooperate.

The government would “walk away” rather than sign up to an agreement that put the health service at risk, he said.

However, the US has demanded “full market access” in the NHS and is known to want to end the ability of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which regulates medicine prices in the UK, to block drugs it does not consider value for money.

The Trump administration also wants to change patent law, potentially paving the way for US drug firms to demand higher prices for their medicines and over a longer period of time.

In his first comments since arriving in the UK for the Nato summit, the US president tried to dismiss his interest in the NHS, saying: “I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly.”

He added: “I don't even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter.”

However, it was quickly pointed out that Mr Trump himself said, on his visit earlier this year: “When you deal in trade, everything is on the table – so, the NHS or anything else.”

Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, seized on the foreign secretary’s comments, saying: “Dominic Raab has finally admitted what we all know – Boris Johnson is opening the door to a Trump trade deal that will force our NHS medicines bill through the roof.”

Currently, prices for prescription drugs in the NHS are set through discussion between manufacturers and the government.

Nice evaluates the cost and clinical effectiveness of each drug to decide which should be purchased at the price being sought, given the limited budget.

There has been no suggestion that this system would change after Brexit, but controversy has escalated over likely hardball US tactics in any trade-deal negotiations.

In the interview, Mr Raab suggested it would not be in US interests to hike prices if “you reduce the amount, the volume of purchases”.

He said: “The key point in this is that we will do the right thing by the patients, the consumers in this country.”

On “drug pricing or any other involvement” in the NHS, Mr Raab insisted: “That is not on the table for negotiations.”

Mr Johnson, on the campaign trail in Wiltshire, said: “This is pure Loch Ness monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff.”","Dominic Raab has admitted that the US will be free to charge higher prices for drugs bought by the NHS after Brexit. but foreign secretary insists the prospect is ""hugely unlikely"""

The EU has repeatedly rejected the proposals because they’re a bit slow and obviously didn’t understand them the first time, but senior figures within parliament are confident that loudly saying ‘SPEAKEE ENGLISHEE’ will break the deadlock.

“The first time we explained the deal we’re after, Michel Barnier just cupped one ear and said ‘Que?’, so we think there’s room for movement there,” said MP Simon Williams.

”All Theresa May has to do to make Parliament happy is get the deal we have been specifically told isn’t on the table – and she can do that by raising her voice and enunciating ev-er-y syl-lab-ble. Like that,” he added.

“If I were Prime Minister I would have done it by now. It would have been dead easy, but I know how to talk to foreigners as I holiday in the Peloponnese every year.”

He called on the British people to unite, to “let the healing begin” and to focus on the NHS. The Tories had broken through the “red wall”. They seemed all-powerful. It was Labour that faced existential questions.

Now, with about two years to go until the probable date of the next election and with Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, both ousted by their own MPs, Labour is between 15 and 20 percentage points ahead in the polls at the end of 2022.

The NHS is on its knees and beset by strikes. It is desperately short of money and staff, with nurses, doctors and paramedics leaving in their thousands. Not a penny of the £350m a week that Johnson said Brexit would release for the health service has ever been seen. Increasingly, the whole Brexit endeavour is viewed by business leaders and economists as a self-inflicted disaster that has severely weakened the British economy, despite continued claims to the contrary by former Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg on the BBC’s Question Time last week.

For Brexiters who followed Johnson, it was not supposed to be like this. He had promised them a new dawn of independence, deregulation, prosperity based on global trade deals and lower taxes. Instead, the reality is one of diminishing UK influence, dud trade deals or none at all (notably with the US), extra bureaucracy, reduced exports, lower gross domestic product and higher taxes.

Brexit and the fear of a Jeremy Corbyn government helped power the Tories to an 80-seat majority. But disgruntled Brexit supporters are crying betrayal. They make the case that Brexit has been catastrophically mishandled and needs new management. Worryingly for Tory MPs, that is precisely what is being offered by Reform UK, the latest incarnation of the Brexit party, which stands at 8% in Sunday’s Opinium poll for the Observer – 1 point behind the Liberal Democrats and rising.

Before the party is even particularly well known, 19% of all voters questioned by Opinium said they would consider voting for Reform UK and its populist agenda on immigration, doing Brexit properly and lowering taxes, including 23% of 2019 Conservative voters and 11% of 2019 Labour voters.

One such convert is businessman David White from Barnsley. Until a few days ago he was a Tory councillor in the South Yorkshire town, but then defected and joined Reform UK. He is one of 9,000 nationally who the party’s leader, Richard Tice, says have signed up over the last two months.

Reform UK has a broad range of policies beyond doing Brexit better, such as offering a pay rise to nurses by exempting them from the basic rate of income tax for three years.

“When I announced the switch to Reform, I looked at my Facebook page with a little bit of trepidation,” says White. “I was expecting a bit of stick, but I had massive support, even from core Conservatives. Even the trolls that normally have a go didn’t say anything. I think people suddenly realised that Reform is the real threat in the next elections.”

He puts immigration top of his list. “Immigration is one of the main issues from Brexit that people just don’t feel has been sorted out at all. It’s off the scale. There’s a hotel down the road that’s full. I got some video sent to me the other night of immigrants in this hotel outside playing football at midnight with the floodlights on and drinking coffee, and that just rankles with people.”

Throughout this part of South Yorkshire, as across much of the red wall, there is disillusion with Labour as well as the Tories. Lynne Dunning has lived nearby in the former mining village of Goldthorpe, eight miles from Barnsley, for 47 years.

“People feel abandoned by both parties,” she says. “And I voted for Brexit, but what we’ve got isn’t what people voted for. It doesn’t seem to have happened as it was promised. I think a lot of people feel like that.”

It is very early days for Tice’s party – but Dunning’s disillusion is exactly the kind of sentiment he is seeking to tap into. He calls the Conservatives “Consocialists” and says the two main parties are indistinguishable in the bland left-of-centre ground. This way, he hopes to defuse the fear among Tories that voting for an insurgent party such as his might let in a leftwing Labour government.

“They are both variants of socialism,” says Tice. “You have got the Consocialists and then there are the red socialists. There is no difference.” He says the Tories have betrayed Brexit and that he wants to destroy them. “I want the Tories out. I want them destroyed. I think they have ruined our economy. Don’t underestimate us. They have deeply, deeply damaged this country. I am 58. The country has never been in a worse state.”

Tory MPs and commentators insist they are not panicking about Reform UK – not yet, at least. Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, says: “They are not yet a problem but if they are around at the general election and we have not sorted our problems out [inflation, the economy, small boats] then they will be.”

Paul Goodman, the former Tory MP who now edits the ConservativeHome website, says the real worry was former party leader Nigel Farage returning to front up Reform UK. “My sense is that most Conservative MPs are not frightened of Richard Tice but would be frightened of Farage.”

Another, serving Conservative MP in a northern seat with many Brexit voters agrees. He says: “I don’t see them as a huge problem right now but if Farage came along to lead them, it would be different.” The MP, who wishes to remain anonymous, adds: “Keep my name out of it. I don’t them want to target me.”

For Tories less preoccupied with Brexit but concerned about what they see as their party’s broader centrist drift, Reform UK is also proving attractive, with its deliberately wide policy offerings.

Kabeer Kher, a mortgage adviser who lives in Norfolk, joined the Conservatives in 2015 and remained a member until a few months ago, when he was tipped over the edge into joining Reform UK. “For me, the Conservatives have just become blue Labour now,” he says. “I don’t understand how they can have the policies they have, and still call themselves the Conservative party – they’ve just abandoned their principles.”

He complains about green policies, tax and housing. “The net-zero goals they’ve set for reducing emissions have not been accompanied by any thought about where we were going to get the electricity power generation to actually facilitate that.

“Taxes on landlords have absolutely gone through the roof. The supply of rental properties has gone through the floor. I’ve got landlords now calling me every week saying: ‘I want to sell my property – can you recommend an estate agent?’ Meanwhile, business rates are killing the high street. There’s no long-term thinking on anything.”

Kher believes that it is the speed at which the green agenda is being pushed through by the government that will help drive voters to Reform UK: “We will pick up a lot of their voters. The Reform party is now the only party that doesn’t subscribe to the green agenda and the speed with which they’re doing it.”

Among the Tory grassroots, who did not get a chance to vote for Truss’s successor and feel they had Rishi Sunak foisted upon them, there are concerns that under the new prime minister they are becoming the party of high taxes and a big state. They also feel disenfranchised.

A group of prominent figures on the right have now launched an attempt to seize greater control over the party to stop what they regard as a shift to the left – to a social democrat type of Tory party.

Peter Cruddas, a Tory peer and former party treasurer, who has donated more than £3.5m to the Tories, is now involved in the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO), which aims to hand members more power over MP selections and leadership elections. He was given his peerage by Johnson, who he believes should never have been removed as leader. He warned that a “drag to the left by the current leadership” was opening the party up to a political threat from a Ukip-style party on the right.

“Absolutely, I do fear that,” says Lord Cruddas. “There is a conduit for right-leaning, centre-right people to find a new home, and that’s the Reform party, especially if Farage comes out and says he is going to lead [it]. If Conservatives and Conservative party members want to be a centre-left party, then that’s up to them. But then I think you’ll see major changes in the political landscape. Because whether you agree with it or not, I believe that this country is a centre-right-leaning electorate.

“What you’re seeing today is a coup and a hijacking of the Conservative party by centre-left leaning people. They don’t outnumber those on the centre right. The senior Conservatives that I’ve spoken to are also frustrated as well.

“Something’s going to come to a head because the members don’t want Rishi Sunak. They didn’t vote for him and he was imposed upon the Conservative party. The odds are stacked against him, but he’s there under false pretences.”

Cruddas adds: “What we’ve seen since 2010 is an engineering of the Conservative party to take us to the centre, possibly to the left, and there’s a lot of MPs out there that we consider are not Conservative.

“We are a centre-right, Conservative organisation that wants to empower the members and stick to our principles. There are centre-right politicians, but we don’t think we’re being led by Conservatives. And we think the Conservative party has been infiltrated by non-Conservatives.”

For Cruddas, the feelings of Brexit betrayal contribute to his discontent. “We voted for Brexit. We didn’t vote to annex Northern Ireland to be part of the European Union. And we need to continue to control our borders. These are centre-right policies that the country voted for. And now, they’ve not happened and we’re going to get punished at the polls. And we want the world to know that this is not what the members want.”

With these kind of views now fairly common in the Tory party, Tice is relishing the prospect of more defections. “We are potentially seeing the dying days of the last majority Tory government in our lifetime,” he says. “And that is an exciting thought.”","the NHS is desperately short of money and staff, with nurses, doctors and paramedics leaving in their thousands. the whole Brexit endeavour is viewed by business leaders and economists as a self-inflicted disaster."

Liz Truss during a visit to Brussels earlier this year. The Foreign Secretary has reportedly ‘given up’ on Brexit talks.

The government will reportedly move to discard large portions of the Northern Ireland Protocol after giving up on Brexit negotiations with the EU.

The Times newspaper reported officials working for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have drawn up draft legislation to unilaterally remove the need for checks on all goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland.

The law would also ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are able to disregard EU rules and regulations and remove the power of the European Court of Justice to rule on issues relating to the region, the paper said.

Importantly, the bill would override the protocol agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2019 and mean the UK had breached its obligations under the Brexit agreement.

Trade war

The Times said Truss is understood to have concluded talks with the EU and has been told the proposed bill could lead to a trade war with the bloc.

It comes after The Sunday Telegraph said Truss faces Cabinet opposition, particularly from Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, to her plans to rip up the protocol.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, meanwhile, has said that he will not lead the DUP back into powersharing until the issue is resolved, suggesting the prospects of any quick return of the devolved powersharing Executive at Stormont are diminishing.

MLAs returned to Parliament Buildings on Monday and party leaders were also holding separate meetings with Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.

Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said that the DUP and British Government must accept and respect the democratic result of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections.

The Prime Minister has said he does not plan to be personally involved in the Northern Ireland talks, while Downing Street played down the reported Cabinet rift over the protocol.

Asked about the Government’s position on the protocol and whether there are divisions within Cabinet over proposals to unilaterally scrap it, Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said: “I wouldn’t say that at all.

“I think our preference has always been for a negotiated solution to fix the protocol and we have been clear that we will take further steps if solutions can’t be found.” Boris Johnson spokesman

“No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. The Deputy Prime Minister made clear the situation, it’s very serious.”

He insisted the proposals put forward by the European Commission “don’t go anywhere near far enough to make the protocol sustainable”, adding: “We believe (they) would take us backwards from where we are today. So no decisions have been taken. But we do reserve the right to take action.”

That line echoed earlier comments on Monday by Tory MP Michelle Donelan, in which the universities minister said scrapping the protocol was “on the table as one of the options” in the wake of Sinn Fein’s success in the Stormont elections.

Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis last week intimated a move against the Northern Ireland Protocol was unlikely to feature in the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday.

Brexit has overtaken Covid as the number one concern of the British people for the first time since the pandemic began, new polling has found.

The supply chain crisis which has seen labour shortages and empty supermarket shelves has pushed the impact of the UK-EU divorce back to the forefront of the public imagination.

Some 28 per cent of people said Brexit is the biggest issue facing the nation – a rise of eight per cent since last month, according to the latest Ipsos MORI survey.

There has been a significant dip in the proportion who see Covid as a major issue for the country – only 27 per cent now considerate it the most important concern, down ten points from September.

It comes as chancellor Rishi Sunak laughed off warnings from his own budget watchdog that Brexit was causing serious damage to the British economy.

The chairman of the UK’s fiscal watchdog said on Thursday that the impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse than that caused by the pandemic.

Richard Hughes said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had assumed the impact of the UK leaving the EU would “reduce our long run GDP by around 4 per cent”.

He also told BBC: “We think that the effect of the pandemic will reduce that (GDP) output by a further 2 per cent.”

But Mr Sunak dismissed warnings from his own budget watchdog. The chancellor claimed Britain’s departure from the EU was “five years ago” and said the government was capitalising on benefits of the UK departure.

“What I’m doing is making sure that we capitalise on the opportunities that Brexit has brought,” Mr Sunak claimed. “We’re seeing the benefits that [it] will bring to the economy, and our ability to sign trade deals around the country.”

Asked about the official assessment on Brexit impacts, No 10 insisted that exiting the EU had given the government greater powers to boost the British economy.

Asked on Thursday whether a 4 per cent long-term cut to GDP was a price worth paying for Brexit, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the Budget had shown the “agility, flexibility and freedom” the UK now had after the EU divorce.

Brexit rows with EU leaders have also intensified again in recent days. Mr Johnson’s government is asking for further talks with French and EU officials over the reasons for UK trawler has been detained by France.

Ministers have condemned France’s seizure of a British fishing boat in French waters as “disproportionate” in a dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights that risks spinning out of control.

And the leader of the DUP leader said talks between the UK and EU on the contentious Irish Sea trade border need to reach resolution “very, very soon”.

Sir Jeffrey has warned that he will pull down power-sharing arrangements at Stormont if significant changes to the Northern Ireland protocol are not secured by early November.

Brexit is seen to be a far bigger concern by Labour supporters over Conservatives (35 per cent to 17 per cent), the Ipsos MORI poll found.

Meanwhile, worries about the economy and pollution also feature close to the top of public concerns (26 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).

Worry about the NHS has fallen seven points since last month, but on 23 per cent it remains one of the major issues for voters.",some 28 per cent of people said Brexit is the biggest issue facing the nation. only 27 per cent now consider it the most important concern.
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/6j79g0/lord_buckethead_a_pain_au_chocolat_could/,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/24/lord-buckethead-theresa-may-glastonbury-sleaford-mods,Lord Buckethead: 'A pain au chocolat could negotiate Brexit better than Theresa May',"He stood for election in Maidenhead, Theresa May’s constituency, on a mandate of “strong, not entirely stable, leadership”, and received 249 votes.



But that wasn’t the first time Lord Buckethead had been propelled into the spotlight, with a namesake having stood against Margaret Thatcher as well as John Major in previous general elections.

Speaking to the Guardian at Glastonbury after introducing the Sleaford Mods on the Park stage, Lord Buckethead refused to comment on whether he was the same person who stood in those counts, but added: “I am Buckethead, he had a buckethead, we are legion.”

Live videos of the night of the election showed the prime minister subtly rolling her eyes at Buckethead after his name was announced, but he did not know about that until afterwards, he revealed.

“She was very polite to me on the evening. She said good evening back to me, she was careful to ask about the other candidates, I was actually quite impressed by her politeness. Then I see that she rolled her eyes and I thought this woman has another side to her. Sadly, we only saw one side to her in the election and that’s why she’s now up a certain creek without a paddle. In plain English, she’s buggered. She’s doomed.

“If she chose to be less polite with whoever advised her to hold the election I would support her 100%, because someone has given her very bad advice and she has torched her career and it’s very, very sad.”

Warming to his theme, Lord Buckethead added: “I saw her traipse into a Maidenhead leisure centre – and I would say this, she looked terrible, she looked as if the world was caving in on her shoulders. I just increased my vote share from 1992 to a Lord Buckethead record; she lost her majority. So who should be rolling their space eyes at whom?”

Buckethead appeared on John Oliver recently after the late-night host said he should be sent to Europe to negotiate Brexit.

“Could I negotiate Brexit better than Theresa May and David Davis? Yes,” he said of the suggestion. “Could a slightly mouldy pain au chocolat negotiate Brexit better than Theresa May and David Davis? Yes. So yes I could, but whether I should is another matter.”

Asked what advice he would give May and Davis for Brexit negotiations, he said: “Be sophisticated, the Europeans are a smart bunch. There was a photograph the other day of the negotiating team from Great Britain and the negotiating team from Europe and the team from Europe looked so much smarter, they looked smarter sartorially, intellectually, and they had women, which is something British diplomats seem to have forgotten.

“My solution would be: one, negotiate in an adult sensible way to create the best thing for Britain economically, not politically for the right wing of the Tory party, and two, I would urge earthlings to think twice because you’re all so small. One minute Britain wants to leave Europe, the next Scotland wants to leave Britain, the next Edinburgh will probably want to leave Scotland. It’s mad, I’ve seen the asteroid that’s coming to hit you all. If I were you I would stick together.”

Among policies put forward by Buckethead were plans to nationalise Adele. “She’s too good, too bloody good,” he said with enthusiasm, “and Ed Sheeran too, they are money-making machines, and I just think the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, call themselves radical, but this is radical. She’s a great British asset, they’re worth far more than the rail network, bring them in, let’s use their worth to help the country grow.”

Buckethead congratulated Corbyn and McDonnell on doing as well as they did in the election: “It’s just that doing as well as they did was also losing by 60 seats. It’s like losing a football match 7-2 and saying we scored two bloody good goals,” he said.

He was inspired to enter the political fray because “it would be difficult not to get involved when you see the rank awfulness of all the competition, it’s like snooker player Steven Hendry thinking I’ll carry on because everyone is shit. It would be harder not to.

“There are so many ludicrous things said by politicians who claim to be serious,” he added. Probed on a contentious figure such as Boris Johnson, he said: “I think Boris Johnson is a posh, overblown, full-of-himself imbecile, who thinks just because he knows a little bit of classics he has some superiority over the rest of species, but I say flocci non facio, Boris Johnson.”

Being at Glastonbury was a fantastic experience for Buckethead. “I think the Sleaford Mods are a lovely gang, I had a chat with them beforehand, they said to me ‘Lord, do your stuff’ and I thought that’s the kind of guys I can relate to.

“I just hope the rain stays away for your sake and in particular for mine because on my planet space lords have no need to combat rain. If the storms come I am in deep trouble.”

To earthlings he had one simple message: “Peace and love and if anyone wants to buy a laser off me, send me an email.”","he stood for election in maidenhead, theresa may's constituency, on a mandate of ""strong, not entirely stable, leadership"" and received 249 votes. he refused to comment on whether he was the same person who stood in those counts, but added: ""i am Buckethead, he had a buckethead, we are legion"""

Ratcliffe, a petrochemicals magnate with an estimated £17.5bn fortune, has this week officially changed his tax domicile from Hampshire to Monaco, the sovereign city-state that is already home to many of the UK’s richest people.

It has been estimated that the move will save him £4bn in tax payments. People who live in Monaco for at least 183 days a year do not pay any income or property taxes. The highest tax rate in the UK is 45% on income above £150,000-a-year.

Before he left for Monaco, Ratcliffe was the UK’s third-highest individual taxpayer, paying £110m to the exchequer in 2017-18, according to the Sunday Times tax list.

His decision to quit Britain came soon after he was knighted by the Queen for “services to business and investment”, and the UK voted to leave the European Union.

Ratcliffe, the founder and chief executive of petrochemicals company Ineos, was an ardent supporter of the vote leave campaign, declaring that the UK would thrive without red tape from Brussels.

After the referendum, he urged the government to adopt a tough approach to negotiations with the EU, saying: “We must listen, we must be unwaveringly polite and retain our charm. But there is no room for weakness or crumpling at 3am when the going gets tough and most points are won or lost.”

Ratcliffe said the EU needed access to the UK’s market as much as Britain needed access to the EU’s. “Never forget that we have a decent set of cards,” he said, adding: “Mercedes is not going to stop selling cars in the UK. And London is one of the two key financial centres, and that isn’t going to change.”

Ratcliffe, who owns 60% of Ineos, has seen his personal fortune increase from an estimated £9.5bn in January 2019 to £17.5bn today, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. That estimated wealth has increased by £1.25bn so far this year alone, despite the coronavirus pandemic.

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/v0txn4/same_nightmare_week_after_week_uk_firms_fed_up/,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/30/brexit-uk-firms-eu-trade-northern-ireland,‘Same nightmare week after week’: UK firms fed up with post-Brexit EU trade,"Mark Brearley is still frustrated by Brexit. More than a year from Britain’s formal withdrawal from the EU, on terms agreed by Boris Johnson’s government, exporting the goods his company produces hasn’t got any easier for the London-based manufacturer.

Describing it as “the same nightmare week after week”, he says: “A lot more time is spent with things going wrong. The EU really feels like the hardest place in the world to ship things to sometimes.”

For the past seven decades the company Brearley runs, Kaymet, has made and sold tea trolleys, trays and hotplates from its factory just off the Old Kent Road to customers including the British royal family. It’s thought that Kaymet’s wares were used by the queen – celebrating her platinum jubilee this week – on her coronation world tour. The company sells goods in 40 countries across the world.

But leaving the EU has added to Brearley’s costs and makes selling items abroad more difficult. “There’s loads of things I could’ve been doing if it wasn’t for these problems. We could do things that take us forward, rather than back,” he says.

Official figures show that UK exports to the EU remain significantly below pre-Brexit levels, despite some recovery from an initial plunge in January 2021 at the end of the transition period. Exports had fallen 40% on the month as traders adapted to new red tape and border delays, but came back to finish last year down 11% compared with 2018 – the year used by the Office for National Statistics as the most reliable comparison, before Brexit stockpiling and the Covid pandemic influenced trade flows.

However, concern is mounting that fresh Brexit roadblocks are looming as the government threatens to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol, which covers trade between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Despite Boris Johnson claiming to have “got Brexit done”, his government now views this central plank of his deal as broken.

“There’s a sense of, ‘Oh God, here we go again,”’ says Brearley, who worries that Kaymet will suffer if the EU responds with fresh trade barriers.

Raoul Ruparel, who was Theresa May’s special adviser on Europe during the first round of Brexit negotiations, says companies could start dusting down their old no-deal Brexit plans if the situation worsens.

“Any business will tell you it’s unhelpful,” he says. “In this case, a lot of them are just getting on with it and they just have to make the best of it. But what they don’t want is constantly changing trade rules with the UK and the EU.”

Despite business concerns of retaliation from Brussels, the government has insisted that pushing ahead is the right thing to do. “The UK’s solution to fix the problems with the protocol and protect the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement will cut costs for businesses, remove unnecessary paperwork and protect UK and EU markets,” a spokesperson said.

There could, however, be economic costs. Steffan Ball, the former chair of Philip Hammond’s council of advisers when he was chancellor, and now chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, says the most likely outcome is a “compromise deal”. Still, risks of “significant economic impacts” loom if one isn’t reached, he warns.

“Back in 2020, the Office for Budget Responsibility [OBR] estimated that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would reduce the level of real GDP by an additional 2% in the long run. In addition, the escalation in tensions raises the prospect of a trade war, with potential tariffs imposed on exports to the EU,” he says. “But this outcome is very unlikely in our view.”

Even with the current deal, the OBR – the Treasury’s economics forecaster – expects Brexit to cost the economy 4% of GDP over 15 years, double the long-term impact of the scarring from the Covid pandemic.

Trade figures suggest UK exporters are already feeling the pinch. According to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, which tracks trends in global trade, goods exports in March from advanced economies – including the UK, US, Japan and euro area – were 2% above the monthly average for 2018, after adjusting for inflation. In the UK, however, real exports were almost 22% down in the same month.

Some sectors have suffered a more dramatic hit than others. Exports of clothing and footwear to the EU are both down by almost 60% compared with 2018. Meat exports have plunged by almost 25%, vegetables and fruit by 40%, while car exports are down by more than a quarter.

Paul Alger, director of international affairs at the UK Fashion and Textile Association, says the outsize hit for his industry is probably because many of the items sold by UK firms do not qualify for the post-Brexit trade deal. Under its terms, goods must meet “rule of origin” requirements, which require a certain proportion of an item to be domestically produced to benefit from tariff-free access. However, much of the clothing sold by UK retailers is made in Asia or the US, making it ineligible.

“They’re also finding that customs are very difficult in some countries. Particularly around labelling,” said Alger. “A lot of companies will say we didn’t realise how good a deal we had for moving goods from the UK to the EU until we actually left.”

In one example of shifting trade patterns, Marks & Spencer is setting up a warehouse to handle EU deliveries of clothing and homewares to reduce the impact of tariffs and export costs. The British high street stalwart said last week that Brexit had cost it £29.6m in profits and £15m in lost trade.

Danny Hodgson runs Rivet & Hide, which sells quality men’s clothing from stores in London and Manchester as well as online. He says EU sales, which he spent a decade building, plunged by half in the first month after Brexit and never recovered.

“It’s really frustrating,” he says. Rivet & Hide has pushed up prices for EU customers to include new tariffs, VAT and shipping costs.

“I hear Johnson boasting about free trade and all the rest of it. I don’t know how he’s got the brass neck to talk about us doing free trade when basically he’s the one who’s imposed sanctions on our business. “We were freely trading with the EU and now we’ve had tariffs imposed on us through our Brexit deals.”

With Britain’s economy facing the risk of recession amid the cost of living crisis, Hodgson says the government has caused harm to the British economy that could have easily been avoided.

“We’re less profitable, there’s a lot more work involved, there’s a lot more hassle, but I’m still slogging away at it in the hope one day things improve,” he says. “But if there was a trade war, it would finish that off.”",exports to the EU remain significantly below pre-Brexit levels. despite some recovery from an initial plunge in January 2021 at the end of the transition period.

The EU is prepared for Britain to cancel Brexit, the president of the European Council has said.

Speaking in Brussels after a day of turmoil in Westminster, Donald Tusk said a “no-Brexit scenario” was still on the cards and that the EU would be ready for it.

It comes after EU officials warned that the controversial deal struck by Theresa May is “the best we can do” given the prime minister’s red lines and the bloc’s own rules.

Ms May admitted this week that no Brexit was a possibility if her deal is voted down – itself an increasingly likely prospect.

Mr Tusk said on Thursday morning that even with the agreement, Brexit was “lose-lose” and about “damage control”.

Speaking later in the day he went further, telling reporters in Brussels: “The EU is prepared for a final deal with the United Kingdom in November.

“We are also prepared for a no-deal scenario but of course we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario.”

Speaking early in the morning alongside chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Tusk said he did not share Ms May’s assessment of Britain’s future prospects under the deal.

Of course we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario Donald Tusk, president of European Council

“I took good note of prime minister May’s statement yesterday,” he said.

“Of course, I don’t share the prime minister’s enthusiasm about Brexit as such. Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation and that our negotiations are only about damage control.”

The comments by the Council president are likely to be ammunition for those in the UK – on both the Remain and Leave sides – who say the deal struck by Ms May gives little benefit to Britain.

A spate of ministers have resigned from the cabinet and Tory Brexiteers, Labour, and the DUP all say they would vote against it.

But the prospect of the UK staying in is thought to be the government’s biggest trump card in encouraging Tory backbenchers to vote for a plan they do not want.

Mr Barnier defended the fundamentals of the plan, stating: “What we have agreed at negotiators level is fair and balanced, organises the withdrawal in an orderly fashion, ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland, and lays the ground for an ambitious new partnership.”

The agreement effectively keeps the UK tied to swathes of EU regulations through “non-regression” and “level playing field” clauses, ramps up some checks and controls across the Irish sea, and is founded on the premise of a customs union with the bloc.

Senior EU officials warned that there could be no renegotiation of the agreement within the context of the PM’s red lines. Speaking in the EU capital on Thursday, one said the withdrawal agreement was “the best we can do” given the current constraints on both sides.

“I would say that for the negotiators, we are happy to stand over this agreement and we think this is the best we can do collectively with the constraints we have on both sides,” the senior official said when asked if the plan could be renegotiated if MPs voted it down.

“That is as far as I can go and I’m not going to speculate on any other scenario.”

The official added that they would not “speculate” about the deal’s failure to pass, and said: “We think, on both sides, we have exhausted our margin of manoeuvre and our respective mandates, and if someone comes with wishes for changes they also have to take responsibility and what it does to the process.”

The latest line in the sand from Brussels stops short of ruling out a renegotiation, but effectively means that red lines would have to change for a substantially different deal to emerge.

European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said at lunchtime on Thursday that the deal reflected the fact “that any outcome will be inferior to full membership”.

On the continent, EU member states have also expressed some concerns about the nature of the future relationship – warning that it might give the UK a competitive advantage over countries in the single market.

French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday his country would “be very careful to ensure that the agreement does not weaken the single market” before signing it off.

Mr Barnier himself said the future relationship portion of the agreement, in particular, was “not finished” and hinted there could be changes to the text, suggesting it needed to be “finalised”.

“This work will now be intense,” he said. “Our goal is to finalise this political declaration with the UK so the European Council can endorse it.”

Mr Tusk, who was speaking alongside, added: “The agreement is now being analysed by all the member states. By the end of this week, the EU27 ambassadors will meet in order to share their assessment of this agreement.

“They will also discuss the mandate for the commission to finalise the joint political declaration for the future declaration.

She was then asked by presenter Frei, “Freedom to do what?”, to which Currie replied: “Two fingers to Brussels. It’s fabulous.”

Currie also told Frei he was expecting a “magic wand” and claimed the benefits “take time” to appear.

She continued, saying that since Brexit, “we can take our own decisions, we can make up our own minds”.

The former health secretary under Margaret Thatcher also argued that the UK is now “doing far more trade now with countries outside Europe”.

However, her claims were disputed by Frei, who said: “I don’t think the numbers stack up.

“Our decline [in] trade with the European Union far outweighs the benefits of any trade negotiations – trade deals – we’ve struck with Japan and so on.”

Currie’s comments have come under fire from some as “infantile”.

One person wrote: “Edwina Currie names the Brexit benefits as ‘freedom’ and ‘two fingers to Brussels’.

“Two completely infantile and diplomatically incontinent claims. Summing up the whole miserably dishonest project and the prejudiced idiocy of those who still support it.”

Another said: “Benefits of Brexit? asks Matt Frei on LBC. Edwina Currie: ‘FREEDOM! and two fingers to Brussels’.

“That’s the level, folks…”

Someone else wrote: “Edwina Currie being challenged to name Brexit benefits on LBC.

“So far, she can only come up with ‘freedom’ and ‘there is no magic wand and it will take time’ and ‘it is a very exciting time.

“Utterly pathetic.”

Downing Street was today forced to issue a statement insisting that Boris Johnson has read the full text of his EU trade deal, after comments by his official spokesman raised doubts on the issue.

Fisheries minister Victoria Prentis has come under fire for saying that she did not read the Trade and Cooperation Agreement when it came out on Christmas Eve because she was busy organising a nativity event.

But when Mr Johnson’s official spokesman was asked repeatedly whether the PM had read every word of the 1,246-page document, he was unable to confirm that he had.

Instead, he told a Westminster media briefing: “The prime minister is fully aware of the deal that we agreed.”

Pressed on whether Mr Johnson expected his cabinet colleagues to read the TCA text, the spokesman said: “The prime minister and the cabinet and other ministerial colleagues are fully aware of the deal we agreed with the EU.”

After the publication of reports suggesting his comments indicated that the PM had not read the entire document, No 10 issued a statement: “The PM has read the deal.”

Mr Johnson has offered Ms Prentis his backing after she faced calls to quit over her admission.

Asked if her jaw had dropped when she saw the deal with the EU on Christmas Eve, Ms Prentis told the Lords EU Environment Sub-Committee: ""No, the agreement came when we were all very busy on Christmas Eve, in my case organising the local Nativity trail.

""We had been waiting and waiting, it looked like it was coming for probably four days before it actually arrived.

""I, for one, had gone through, as I'm sure members of this committee had, a gamut of emotions over those four days.""

A Number 10 spokesperson said that the Prime Minister had confidence in Ms Prentis.

But the SNP took a dim view of her behaviour and insisted she should stand down and that her position was “untenable.”

The comments came following delays to seafood exports after the Brexit transition period ended on New Year's Eve.

The SNP's Brexit spokesperson Philippa Whitford, said: ""Due to Brexit-induced bureaucracy, Scotland's fishing communities are already experiencing severe disruption and cannot get their produce to their customers in the EU market on time.

""For the Tory Government's fisheries minister to then admit that she did not even bother to read the details of the damaging deal because she was too busy is unbelievable and makes her position untenable.""","downing street forced to issue statement insisting that the pm has read the deal. spokesman was asked repeatedly if he had read the entire 1,246-page document. he said: 'the pm is fully aware of the deal we agreed with the EU'"

I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.

The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:

1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.

3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.

4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.

5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.

6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.

7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.

Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.

The Brexit endgame

Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter divisions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.

Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.

I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.

Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.

It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that diversity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.

The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.

And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.

Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.

Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.

Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.

A Saudi Arabian horror show

The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.

You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis; they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous; it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.

The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.

We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.

Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.

Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays; sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop; in China, a government official; and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.

Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.

There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.

Trump trumps himself

Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.

01:30 Trump: Saudi Arabia decision about 'America first' – video

Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour; it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.

The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.

What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)

Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president; it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.

Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.

03:24 Key moments from Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle – video report

There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.

With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.

A climate of fear

At least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.

Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.

The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.

Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.

I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed. Consider the plight of the satirist.","the plight of the satirist is a compulsion to look at the grimmest thing they can think of and then try to make it funny. to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does."

A version of 'Ode To Joy', the EU's official anthem, has hit the top of the UK's download chart after also topping Amazon's Best Sellers list and iTunes charts in the UK.

The EU's anthem Ode to Joy has exploded onto the UK's download chart, making one small symbolic victory for Remainers as the country officially exits the bloc.

As well as being the most downloaded song of the week, it has also made an entrance at number 30 in the official singles chart.

The result on Friday comes after a campaign from those who opposed Brexit to have their voices heard for a final time as EU citizens.

Meanwhile, a version of the classical piece, written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1785 and conducted by Dutch violinist André Rieu, has climbed at the top of Amazon's best sellers list in the UK. Several other recordings of the song by André Rieu also appear in the top 20 rankings.

The song has also clinched the top spot in the country's iTunes chart.

But Leavers did not give up without a fight with hoping their own song, ""17 Million F**k-Offs"", would chart higher.

The song, written by British comedian Dominic Frisby after the 2016 referendum on EU membership, has been updated ahead of the country's departure on Friday.

The comedian had vowed that if the song reached number one on Brexit Day, proceeds from the sale would be donated to the Maggie Oliver Foundation for victims of child abuse and grooming.",version of 'ode to joy' hits the top of the download chart in the uk. it has also topped amazon's best sellers list and the country's iTunes chart. the result comes after a campaign from those who opposed Brexit to have their voices heard.

John Bercow has branded Brexit the UK's ""biggest mistake"" after the Second World War in a devastating verdict just days after quitting as Speaker.

The former MP finally lashed out and revealed the full force of his opinions after years of claims he was biased against Britain leaving the EU.

Mr Bercow had previously said he voted Remain but insisted he was an impartial Speaker, and avoided giving clear-cut public opinions on the matter.

Yet in his first comments since quitting as an MP on Monday, he told the Foreign Press Association - quoted by La Repubblica - ""I'm no longer the Speaker so I don't have to remain impartial now.

""But if you ask me honestly, 'do I think that Brexit is good for our global standing?', my honest answer is 'no, I don’t'. I think that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period. That is my honest view.""

He added: ""I completely respect the Prime Minister [...] I completely respect the rights of the Prime Minister, leading the largest party in Parliament to try to get support for his position, which is to get Brexit done.

""If he had the numbers, he could have got the first base done. He made a start by getting agreement towards the end, but not to the legislation. And he decided to leave that and instead to seek the public mandate. I respect his right to his view, which is a view very widely shared.

""But there is an alternative view equally that he's very widely shared. And my own personal opinion is that Brexit does not help us. We are part of a world of power blocs and trade blocs, my feeling is that it is better to be part of that power block and of that trade bloc than not.""

Mr Bercow stood down to be replaced by his deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle after more than a decade in the heavy green chair.

He developed a reputation for standing up for MPs' rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons.

But he faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe when he repeatedly granted debates and powers to Remainer MPs.

Brexiteers say he tore up precedent and convention to allow pro-EU MPs to rule against the government and pass laws to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

Mr Bercow was also dogged by allegations of bullying staff, which he denied.

Several of his candidates to succeed him took aim at the outgoing Speaker in the election to replace him on Monday.

And new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said in his opening speech: ""We've got to make sure that tarnish is polished away.

'That the respect and tolerance that we expect from everyone who works in here will be shown and we'll keep that in order.""",former speaker lashed out for the first time since quitting as speaker. he said: 'i think that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period' he stood down to be replaced by his deputy after more than a decade in the heavy green chair.

”It might seem like an inconsistency to you, but I suspect you’re just not terribly bright,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg from his ever-punchable face.

“Theresa May needs to resign and the result of this confidence vote, which I asked for, needs to be ignored.

“At the same time, the referendum result, which was a much closer ball game, should remain as untouched and unchanged as my underpants since 1801.”

Journalist, Simon Williams, said, “God, I want to hit him in his thin smug face every time he draws his tiny mouth into the shapes required to make words.

“Sorry… Yes, what I was saying is that this is an utter shitshow, obviously.

“It now appears that the ones saying that 52% is a decisive victory which represents the will of the people are now saying that 63% doesn’t even count as a ‘win’.

“It smacks of a lack of self-awareness that one typically expects of Donald Trump. It’s sad to see such behaviour has made it over here. I guess this is how Grandad felt when he first had a cheeseburger.”

I think, therefore I am (not a Brexit supporter) – get the t-shirt here!","Jacob Rees-Mogg and others suggest theresa May should still resign. despite winning a confidence vote by nearly two to one, the referendum result should remain untouched with a much smaller percentage of the vote of 52%."

An estimated one million protesters have marched through London to demand a second referendum on Brexit, organisers said.

The demonstration calling for a Final Say on the crisis is believed to be one of the biggest marches in British history.

“The #PeoplesVoteMarch has today become one of the biggest public protests in British history,” a spokesperson for People’s Vote UK claimed on Twitter.

Demonstrators marched from Park Lane to Parliament Square, as MPs attended a spacial Saturday sitting of the Commons.

Many held banners calling for a fresh public vote with the option to Remain in the EU.

Supporters in Parliament Square have heard from speakers including Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, as well as shadow cabinet members Keir Starmer, Diane Abbott and Emily Thornberry.

They will also hear from shadow chancellor John McDonnell.

“I’m proud to stand with hundreds of thousands of people in demanding that they, not wealthy, privileged and out-of-touch hard-right Tory MPs, have the final say on what is an even worse deal than Theresa May’s,” Mr McDonnell said ahead of the march.

“Our policy is clear: Let the people decide.”

The crowd cheered on Saturday afternoon as MPs voted to withhold support from the prime minister’s Brexit deal.

“Hear us,” some chanted outside parliament, while others shouted: “People’s Vote!”

A number of celebrities have also joined the march, including the actors Patrick Stewart and Stephen McGann.

The picture shows a halo of hot air and lost jobs and traces the outline of a massive financial black hole.

Brexit itself – a toxic hell from which neither truth nor the Conservative party can escape – is itself, unseeable. But the newly released picture at least takes us to its insane threshold for the first time, showing the cosmic cliff edge beyond which all known political, economic and social rules break down.

Said professor Simon Williams: “Brexit is one the most mysterious objects in the known universe. We have now seen what we thought was unthinkable. And frankly, I am now crapping myself.”

The picture gives us the first direct look at Brexit’s ‘accretion disk’ – a fuzzy doughnut-shaped ring of gas and crap from the ERG that “feeds” the lurking monster.

At Brexit’s event horizon, light bends in a perfect loop, meaning if you stood there you would literally be able to see the back of your head – and the back of the whole country.

Time is also said to move differently around it, which may explain why so many Brexiters are fixated on a war that ended over seventy years ago. To them, it might seem like only yesterday.

When asked why the image of Brexit looked so fuzzy, Professor Williams said: “I’m baffled frankly. It’s not what we were told to expect at all.”",the picture shows a halo of hot air and lost jobs and traces the outline of a massive financial black hole. it gives us the first direct look at Brexit’s ‘accretion disk’ – a fuzzy doughnut-shaped ring of gas and crap from the ERG.

Just when it looked like the UK’s telly addicts would need to find another boxset to binge it has been announced that Brexit – possibly the greatest farce since Fawlty Towers and a fantasy to rival Game of Thrones – will roll on for at least one more season.

Brexit aficionado Simon Williams had been bracing himself for the show’s emotional finale.

“I’m so happy!” he said. “There’s still so much potential with these characters, so many more votes they could have on Theresa May’s deal.

“I’ve been so worried recently what with all the rumours about the show being cancelled amid falling ratings.

“But the turnout at this month’s Brexit-con demonstrates that there’s still an enormous amount of interest in the programme, even if fans disagree on which way the story should go or whether Theresa May should be replaced as the showrunner.”

However, television critics have never been keen on Brexit and many cite it as the only show which managed to jump the shark before it even began.

“Good writing in any genre is founded on truth,” said critic Victoria Dean.

“There was just so much unbelievable guff in Brexit’s trailer that it was obviously going to be a shit show.

“I mean, all that stuff written on the bus! The ‘breaking point’ poster. The cartoon villains with no shred of humanity.

“Brexit is possibly the most badly conceived series of all time and should never have been commissioned.

Well, you know what I mean…”",fans of the long-running comedy-drama are overjoyed after learning that another season of the popular show has been commissioned. tv critics have never been keen on Brexit and many cite it as the only show which managed to jump the shark before it even began.

Sir John said PM Theresa May was “boxed in” by hardline Brexiteers and warned stalemate in the Commons could leave Britain facing a no-deal scenario.

His comments came as polling showed support for staying in the EU over leaving with no deal if a new referendum was held.

Remaining in the EU would beat leaving with no deal by 54 per cent to 46, according to a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times.

Just 11 per cent of voters would back leaving the EU on the terms put forward by Mrs May in her Chequers deal, with 38 per cent backing a no-deal Brexit and 50 per cent saying they would vote to remain in the EU, the poll showed.

Former Conservative PM Sir John admitted a second referendum has “democratic downsides”, adding: “It has difficulties. But is it morally justified? I think it is.

""If you look back at the Leave campaign a great many of the promises they made were fantasy promises. We now know they are not going to be met.

""A referendum isn't an easy option, but it's not one at this stage that I would rule out.""

Referring to the ""irreconcilable"" stance taken by hardline Tory Brexiteers, Sir John said: ""That has boxed the Government and particularly the Prime Minister into a corner.

""They are a minority of the House of Commons, a substantial minority of the House of Commons, but they are larger than the Government's majority.

Moral justification: Sir John Major / BBC

""The danger at the moment is that they will frustrate every move the Government seek to make and by accident, because nothing can be agreed, we will crash out without a deal.""

His intervention comes as new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab accused the EU of ""irresponsibly"" ramping-up pressure in withdrawal negotiations.

Asked about comments from Brussels that a no deal scenario would mean there would be no specific arrangements in place for UK citizens living on the continent, or for EU migrants in Britain, Mr Raab told the BBC: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side.

""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the Continent and also here.

""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp-up the pressure.""

Mr Raab said he would be returning to Brussels on Thursday for more Brexit talks.

He said: ""If it's reciprocated, the energy that we are going to bring to these negotiations, the ambition, and the pragmatism, we (will) get a deal done in October.""

Mr Raab said it is ""useful"" the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is asking questions about the white paper's detail.

He said: ""This is an unprecedented situation, we're coming out with innovative proposals, we need to work together.

""But actually the fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out the water but asking questions is a good positive sign - that's what we negotiate on.""

Mr Raab's involvement with the Vote Leave campaign was also highlighted after it was referred to the police by the Electoral Commission for breaking spending limits during the EU referendum.

Asked if he believed the watchdog was politically biased, Mr Raab said: ""I'm not getting into all of that - we've got the rule of law and I respect it, and there's been a report out in the papers today about whether actually the Government's campaigning was correct.""

He said it was wrong that some people are looking to ""discredit"" the outcome of the referendum, adding: ""I think part of this is last-ditch tactics by some to try and stop Brexit from happening and what actually we all need to be doing is focusing, coming together, to get the best deal with the EU.""","former tory pm says a second referendum is'morally justified' he warns theresa may is 'boxed in' by hardline Brexiteers. comes as new Brexit secretary accuses the EU of ""irresponsibly"" ramping up pressure in withdrawal negotiations."
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/vkhdxn/what_have_we_done_six_years_on_uk_counts_the_cost/,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/25/what-have-we-done-six-years-on-uk-counts-the-cost-of-brexit,"‘What have we done?’: six years on, UK counts the cost of Brexit","On 23 June 2016, Geoffrey Betts, the managing director of a small office supplies business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, had high hopes for his firm, and the British economy, when he voted for Brexit.

“I thought we would be like … ‘here we go, here we go. We are going to become the most competitive country in Europe and we are going to be encouraging business.’ Now I think: ‘What have we done?’”

His firm, Stewart Superior, has survived, but not without major restructuring and huge efforts to get around obstacles that Brexit has put in the way of the export side of the business.

In late 2020 Betts decided there was no option but to set up a depot inside the EU single market – in the Netherlands – at considerable expense, to avoid costly delays in transit, mountains of Brexit-related paperwork at the border, and VAT issues when sending goods to customers on the continent.

The switch means that, 18 months on, he has retained a decent slice of trade with customers inside the EU. But because his goods are now distributed from the Dutch depot, tax revenues which would have gone to the UK exchequer now go to the Dutch government instead. Jobs have been created in Holland, not here. Goods that would have been transported from the UK – and created work and employment here – are instead sent direct from the Netherlands to EU destinations, including Ireland.

Last year, with Covid adding to its problems, Stewart Superior lost money for the first time in 20 years.

Betts is “very disappointed” with the UK government. “We are not shipping anything like the amount we were. As a country, we were supposed to be out there trading with the world and yet nothing has happened except we have got a load more paperwork and we have lost lots of our business. It is completely bonkers.”

Asked whether, with hindsight, he would vote Leave if there was a referendum today, Betts says: “I think on the basis of what has happened, I would say No.”

Stewart Superior is one of several small businesses the Observer has been tracking since Boris Johnson finally settled on a hard Brexit and signed a free trade agreement which came into force in January 2021.

Others report the same frustrations. Markets for their goods are there, they say, with potential customers aplenty in the EU. But new obstacles to trade, and hidden costs for customers (particularly demands for VAT on delivery to their doors), as well as the soaring costs of imports caused in part by the post-Brexit devaluation of sterling, mean that in many cases it is simply not worth accessing them.

Unless – that is – companies open a branch back inside the same single market the UK left 18 months ago.

Gyr King, chief executive of King & McGaw, a firm with turnover of more than £10m, which sells fine art prints online from Newhaven, on the south coast, says he has all but stopped exporting to the EU because Brexit-related costs and bureaucracy make it uneconomic.

In some cases he has dispatched artworks to EU destinations only to have them sent back because customers have refused to pay VAT on arrival. For legal reasons, the same goods have had to be sent on another slow and costly journey back to the UK, meaning a big bill landing on King’s desk for an unsold, bespoke item.

In King’s view, Johnson’s hard Brexit defies one basic rule of economics. “If you can’t ship your goods into the biggest market on your doorstep, you have got to be shooting yourself in the foot,” he says.

Leaving the EU has also made it far more difficult to recruit the skilled workers he needs, because the UK no longer enjoys the benefits of free movement of labour. “Brexit has clearly not helped because the reservoir from which we are drawing is much smaller,” he says.

Six years after the referendum which took the UK out of the EU, the economic case for Brexit is proving increasingly difficult for its supporters – including inside the Conservative party – to make.

Most of the trade deals with non-EU countries that the UK has signed have been small in their economic effect, and have merely been “rolled over” from identical ones when we were an EU member. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, has stopped talking about Brexit and the UK economy, and instead focuses on what he says is the democratic dividend, the winning back of control, and the return of sovereignty. That is not surprising because day by day the economic data is piling up showing the harm that leaving the EU is doing to the nation’s finances.

Johnson and the Vote Leave campaign promised in 2016 that £350m a week would flow back from Brussels because we would stop contributing to EU coffers.

The impression was that there would be no downside. We would thrive outside Europe’s bureaucracy which was strangling our companies with red tape. The huge benefits of the single market – trading freely across borders, with common standards – were never highlighted by Vote Leave, and rarely by the crudely alarmist Remain camp, either.

Only now, with the worst of the pandemic (probably) behind us, and ministers unable to blame Covid, is Brexit reality being laid bare.

Next year the OECD calculates that the UK will record the lowest growth in the G20 with the exception of Russia whose economy is being drained by its war on Ukraine.

The Office for Budget Responsibility says Brexit will have a long-term effect of cutting UK GDP by a hefty 4%, an estimate unchanged since early 2020. The Financial Times says such a decline amounts to £100bn in lost output, and £40bn less revenue to the Treasury a year. The UK is now behind all the other G7 nations in the pace of its recovery from the pandemic, with exports by UK small businesses to the EU down significantly.

Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England’s nine-member monetary policy committee, said on Friday that Brexit was “disconnecting the UK from its main trading partners” in a clear example of de-globalisation. An expert at Imperial College on ways to improve productivity, Haskel warned in 2019 that British business investment would likely be weak for several years because of uncertainty linked to Brexit.

Figures from the Centre for European Reform show that the Brexit vote has already depressed economic growth. The independent thinktank said that by the end of last year the economy was 5% – or £31bn – smaller than if the UK had stayed in the EU. Faced with all this, arch-Brexiters are increasingly turning on Johnson. They don’t admit Brexit was a mistake but say it has not yet been made to work.

Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, successor to the Brexit party, told the Observer that the grand ideal was still a good one. “Brexit has given us our sovereignty back, so we can make our own laws, and control our money and borders and not be subject to the European Court of Justice.”

It was just that the rich fruits of Brexit were not yet there to savour because “in its utter incompetence, the Tory government has failed to take much advantage so far, with a few exceptions such as being able to do our own earlier vaccine rollout and some trade deals”.

Tory defeats in Thursday’s Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield byelections suggest that behind the “red wall” and “blue wall” the electoral benefits of saying Johnson “got Brexit done” are not what they were.

In the south-west seat many farmers believed promises on Brexit had been betrayed. There was a sense of rural revolt. Fertiliser and feed prices have soared recently, and payment systems for farmers are mired in confusion.

A constituency steeped in West Country Euroscepticism voted for a profoundly pro-EU party, the Liberal Democrats, sending a tremor through the Conservative party. Other sectors harbour feelings of Brexit betrayal, as the memories of Covid lockdowns fade.

The fishing industry – promised a new lease of life out of the EU – is on the verge of crisis, with rising fuel costs making it almost uneconomic to catch fish, particularly as exporting to the EU is now so burdensome. Trawler crew working on a share of profits now earn less than £3 an hour after diesel is paid for, despite fish being at record prices.

Sarah Ready of the New Under Ten Fishermen’s Association, whose boats are under 10 metres long, said red tape had been increasing since the Brexit vote, and they now faced extra hurdles selling their catches.

Brexit was not supposed to be this way. “Some of the requirements have certainly come since Brexit,” she said. “I think Brexit was a very nasty divorce between us and Europe and obviously they’re not going to make it easy for us on any manner of things.” Paperwork relating to health and hygiene, EU import rules and other monitoring requirements had grown dramatically.

Rees-Mogg said last week he had no intention of monitoring the economic effects of Brexit. “I’m not going to make those sorts of assessments because lots were made before the referendum and they are all bilge,” he said.

Ministers cannot hide reality much longer. What Rees-Mogg was referring to were predictions. Now we have facts, evidence of Brexit affecting people’s lives. Those flying off on holiday can see queues at airports, longer than before Brexit, and ask: why?

Last week the chief executive of easyJet, Johan Lundgren, contradicted claims by the aviation minister Robert Courts that it was “not likely” Brexit had caused staff shortages which have led to disruption at airports. Lundgren countered that 8,000 job applications from EU citizens had been rejected by his firm because candidates did not have permission to work in the UK.

“The pool of people is smaller, it’s just maths,” Lundgren said. “We have had to turn down a huge number of EU nationals because of Brexit. Pre-pandemic we would have turned down 2-2.5% because of nationality issues. Now it’s 35-40%.”

The permanent state of war Johnson’s government maintains with the EU – blaming it for problems caused by the very Brexit deal he negotiated – is making things even worse.

Take UK science. When the UK was in the EU we played a leading role in the Horizon scheme funding research projects across Europe. We provided more lead researchers than any other European nation and received the second largest funding of any member country.

After Brexit, there was a provisional deal for the UK to continue in Horizon – which backs projects from particle physics to vaccine research – as an associated nation. The UK would pay £15bn into the scheme over seven years while its scientists could still bid for Horizon funding.

Then came the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol, an issue that so infuriated the EU it has refused to ratify Britain’s associate membership of the €95bn scheme. Those UK scientists who have received recent grants have been told they must move to an EU country to retain access to funds. Those affected include Cambridge astronomer Nicholas Walton who relinquished leadership of a €2.8m star-mapping project to a colleague in the Netherlands, while Carsten Welsch, a Liverpool University physicist, winner of a €2.6m Horizon grant for plasma research, has been told either to move to the EU or hand over leadership to an EU institution – a situation he describes as “heartbreaking”.

The government is working on a plan that would make up for some of the funding lost if our association with Horizon breaks down, as expected. The result will be less cash for UK science, loss of partnerships with the best European scientists, and a reduced international reputation for our researchers.

Another small UK business which the Observer has followed since January last year sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in this country and the EU. Based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, it employs a few dozen people. Its managing director Andrew Moss, like Geoffrey Betts, has gone to hell and back trying to find ways to survive Brexit. He too has set up a distribution depot in the Netherlands. Also like Betts he feels he has got around Brexit’s blockages, but at a huge cost.

“Our growth stopped five years ago,” says Moss. “70% of our turnover was international before Brexit. It went from 70% to 50% to 30%. We would be twice the size we are now if it were not for Brexit.”","'we are not shipping anything like the amount we were,' says geoffrey Betts. his firm, Stewart Superior, has survived, but not without major restructuring. he set up a depot inside the EU single market – in the Netherlands. but because his goods are now distributed from the Dutch depot, tax revenues which would have gone to the UK exchequer now go to the Dutch government instead."

The survey comes after Richard Hughes, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said his organisation calculated that the negative impact on GDP caused by the UK’s exit from the EU was expected to be twice as great as that resulting from the pandemic.

Hughes said Brexit would reduce the UK’s potential GDP by about 4% in the long term, while the pandemic would cut it “by a further 2%”. “In the long term, it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic,” he said.

Opinium’s findings appear to be in line with other recent polling, including a survey last week by Ipsos MORI, which showed concern about the effects of Brexit rising to the point that it is now seen as the biggest issue for the country alongside Covid-19.

The Opinium survey found that 44% of people think Brexit is having a bad impact on the UK economy, compared with 25% who think it is having a positive effect.

More starkly, 53% of people believe Brexit is having a bad effect on prices in shops, against 13% who think it is having a good effect, while 51% think it is adversely affecting the UK’s ability to import goods from the EU, against 15% who think it is helping.

While chancellor Rishi Sunak’s approval rating rose slightly after his Budget speech on Wednesday, in which he increased government spending to its highest sustained level since the 1970s while warning that inflation would rise to 4% next year, the fact that people appear to be linking Brexit with economic problems including rising prices will be a worry to No 10 and No 11 Downing Street.

During the campaign for Brexit, led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, voters were told by the Leave campaign that leaving the EU would create a more dynamic UK economy able to trade freely across the globe, and less bureaucracy, leading to lower prices.

The OBR report, published alongside Sunak’s budget, said that its evidence to date suggested its previous forecasts that Brexit would lead to a 15% fall in both UK imports from, and exports to, the EU appeared to have been broadly accurate.

The report said: “The evidence so far suggests that both import and export intensity have been reduced by Brexit, with developments still consistent with our initial assumption of a 15% reduction in each.”

It is also made clear that shortages of lorry drivers were at least partly caused by Brexit.

Last week the Financial Times reported that whereas by August this year global goods trade had rebounded sharply since the height of the pandemic (according to the CPB World Trade Monitor), the UK was proving a notable exception, with its exports still sharply down.

Since the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January this year, UK ministers have insisted that difficulties with trade to and from the EU would be short-lived and amounted merely to “teething problems” that would be resolved quickly once companies got used to the new arrangements.

While Opinium found evidence of clear anxiety about Brexit, this has yet to translate into a negative effect on support for the Tory party.

The Conservatives are on 40%, down 1 point compared with a fortnight ago, while Labour is down 2 points on 35%. The Lib Dems are on 8%, the Green party 7%, the SNP 5% and Plaid Cymru 1%.","44% of people think Brexit is having a bad impact on the economy, compared with 25% who think it is having a positive effect. more starkly, 53% of people believe Brexit is having a bad effect on prices in shops, against 13% who think it is having a good effect."

The UK has the legal power to stop Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, the EU‘s top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), has ruled.

The ruling matches legal advice given to the ECJ last week by its advocate general, who said as a sovereign country Britain could reverse its decision even at this late stage.

The legal decision is significant because means Britain could prevent a no-deal Brexit from happening if it wanted, even if Theresa May‘s deal is eventually voted down by MPs. The vote, originally due to be held on Tuesday, has been postponed with no new date yet given.

In their judgment released on Monday morning the panel of judges said it would be “inconsistent with the EU treaties’ purpose of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe to force the withdrawal of a member state” against its wishes.

The court went even further than its advocate general and said the UK could even revoke Article 50 if the period had been extended. This is significant because it means time could be bought to hold a referendum or general election where the result could see Brexit cancelled.

“When a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, as the UK has done, that member state is free to revoke unilaterally that notification,” the Luxembourg court said.

“That possibility exists for as long as a withdrawal agreement concluded between the EU and that member state has not entered into force or, if no such agreement has been concluded, for as long as the two-year period from the date of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, and any possible extension, has not expired.”

The court said any revocation must be decided “following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements”. In the UK, the Supreme Court ruled that a vote of parliament was required to trigger Article 50 in the first place: this condition may apply to revocation.

The UK’s government lawyers had argued at the ECJ that whether Article 50 could be revoked was a hypothetical question, and should not be ruled on. The government had been using the threat of “uncertainty” to convince MPs to vote for Theresa May’s deal, warning that an accidental no-deal could occur if it was rejected by the Commons.

[The] member state is free to revoke unilaterally that notification [of withdrawal] European Court of Justice

The European Council and European Commission’s lawyers were against giving member states the power to revoke Article 50 unilaterally and said the consent of other member states should be required. They argued this on the basis that an extension of the period requires the consent of member states, and said the power could potentially be abused by a malign government hoping to cause trouble.

The ruling is one of the fastest ever made by the court, which normally takes a matter of months to come to a conclusion, even when a case is fast-tracked. The legal question was raised by campaigners through the Scottish courts, which ultimately referred the case to the ECJ.

It was previously legally disputed as to whether Article 50 could be unilaterally revoked, as the wording of the Lisbon Treaty clause is ambiguous.

Stopping Article 50 can prevent the UK leaving but once it has left it would have to rejoin under Article 49 – using the normal process of a country applying for membership.

Dame Margaret Beckett, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said the ruling was “confirmation that it is still up to us to decide whether we want to keep the existing deal we’ve got in the EU rather than accept a bad deal negotiated by the government”.

She added: “What has happened in the last week is that any prospect of no deal has been removed by amendments allowing parliament to take control, while we now all know beyond any doubt that we can stay in the EU – it’s not too late.”

Jo Maugham QC, a senior lawyer and director of the Good Law Project, which backed the case, said: “The tiny Good Law Project and six brave Scottish parliamentarians have taken on the government, the 27 other member states, and the Commission – and won.

“This is the biggest upset since the first Book of Samuel and arguably the most important case in modern domestic legal history.”

He added that the 2016 referendum “would shame a banana republic”, stating: “It is up to MPs to remember what they came into politics for and find the moral courage to put the country’s interests before private ambition.”

A government spokesperson said: “We note the judgment from the CJEU [the Court of Justice of the European Union, of which the ECJ is a part] but this does not change the government’s firm policy that we will not revoke Article 50.

A Brexiteer who was forced to wait in an immigration queue at an EU airport in Amsterdam has complained that ""this isn’t the Brexit I voted for”.

Colin Browning, who described himself as one of the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit, said he was forced to wait for nearly an hour at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol before his passport was checked.

“Absolutely disgusting service at Schiphol airport. 55 minutes we have been stood in the immigration queue. This isn’t the Brexit I voted for,” he wrote on Twitter.

When another user commented on Mr Browning’s post saying he “got what [he] voted for”, the Brexit supporter replied: “I didn’t vote to stand in a queue for over an hour why [sic] some jobsworth checks our passports.

“I spent more time at immigration than I did in the air getting to my destination.”

Although some commenters have suggested that the Twitter post may be a parody, the account has consistently shared posts about Brexit and other issues in recent months which do not appear to be satirical.

Mr Browning has been approached for further comment on his experience at the airport.

Officials at Schiphol have previously warned that people travelling from the UK could expect delays upon arriving in Amsterdam after Britain's exit from the EU.

Recommended Britons face being turned away at EU airports over new passport rules

Analysis by the Dutch government has suggested it could take between an extra 50 minutes to an hour for passengers on busy flights to get through the system due to additional document checks.

However, it is unlikely that current delays have been caused by Brexit as the UK is currently in a transition period with the EU during which travel arrangements will not change until January 2021.

Frances Coppola, a finance journalist for Forbes and the Financial Times, said airports such as Schiphol appeared to have “jumped the gun” by directing British passport holders to non-EU gates but noted that the change would be implemented across all EU countries from next year.

“I'm afraid it is exactly what you voted for. You were told by Remainers that this would be the consequence, but you dismissed their warnings as #ProjectFear,” she wrote in response to the tweet.

A spokesperson for Schiphol told The Independent there had been no changes for British travellers arriving at the airport.

""New Royal Netherlands Marrechaussee staff members were being trained yesterday, leading to longer queues at the passport control than usual,"" the spokesperson said, adding that there would be no further changes while negotiations are ongoing between the UK and EU.

On Thursday, the UK government confirmed that tough new travel rules will come into effect next year which could mean a traveller whose British passport has almost 15 months to run may be turned away from EU airports.

HM Passport Office has issued a notice stating that British travellers will need at least six months left on their passport to travel to most countries in Europe after Brexit.

However, strict EU rules on passport validity for travellers visiting from outside the bloc will mean that some British travellers may be turned away even though they have many more months left on their passport.","Colin browning, one of 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit, said he was forced to wait for nearly an hour at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol before his passport was checked. he said he spent more time at immigration than he did in the air getting to his destination."

Emmanuel Macron has branded the leaders of the campaign for Brexit “liars”, in an extraordinary attack at the close of the Salzburg summit.

The Leave victory was “pushed by those who predicted easy solutions”, the French president said, adding: “Those people are liars. They left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it.”

At the press conference, Mr Macron also made clear he would not accept a “blind deal” – which would leave the nature of the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU to be decided after departure day.

The stance is another blow to Theresa May, given that the EU’s rejection of her Chequers plan has increasingly left a “blind Brexit” as the only possible agreement.

Mr Macron did not name the “liars” behind Brexit, but he targeted those who had promised that leaving the EU would “bring a lot of money home”.

The Vote Leave campaign, fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, infamously pledged it would deliver an extra £350m a week for the NHS – a claim now widely discredited.

“Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, and that it's going to bring a lot of money home, are liars,” Mr Macron added.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said he still did not believe the UK would crash out of the EU without a deal – but insisted the EU would be ready if it did.

“No deal is not my working assumption, but would it happen, then we are prepared because the commission has prepared in detail all the elements of consequences of a no-deal.”

Mr Juncker added: “So don't worry. Be happy, don't worry.”","Emmanuel Macron has branded the leaders of the campaign for Brexit ‘liars’. he also made clear he would not accept a ‘blind deal’ – leaving the nature of the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU to be decided after departure day. the french president did not name the ‘liars’ behind Brexit, but he targeted those who had promised that leaving the EU would “bring a lot of money home”."

An obscure rule is to be used to deny MPs a crucial vote aimed at blocking imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef, sparking fresh fears about food quality after Brexit.

Ministers are facing fierce criticism over their tactic to defeat an attempt to give powers to a new watchdog – amid suspicions that future trade deals, particularly with the US, will water down food and animal welfare standards.

The move to prevent debate on a key amendment expected to be backed by Tory rebels in a Commons showdown on Monday has been condemned as “unbelievable” by the peer who introduced it in the Lords.

The tactic was also attacked by the Conservative chair of the Commons environment committee, who told The Independent: “The Commons is wrongly being denied a say on a technicality.”

Neil Parish added: “The government should allow a vote. These are really important matters for the future of food and farming.”

Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, urged MPs to find a way to secure “binding commitments that strengthen scrutiny of trade deals and safeguard our animal welfare and environmental standards”.

Ministers will dodge the vote by arguing that giving increased powers to the new Trade and Agriculture Commission – currently temporary and advisory only – will impose an extra cost.

They will argue that goes beyond the powers of the Lords and so refuse a money resolution – preventing the amendment to the Agriculture Bill being called.

Liz Truss, the trade secretary, who opened the door to chlorinated chicken in her trade negotiations with Washington earlier this year, informed senior MPs of the move late last week.

She promised Commons committees earlier scrutiny of trade deals – but this is seen as falling far short of examination by an independent commission, which would have to sign off those agreements.

Lord Curry of Kirkharle, who carried out a landmark food review for Tony Blair and who put forward the successful Lords amendment, said: “It’s unbelievable and a huge mistake by the government.

“I can’t think of an issue in recent times which has so much public support. For the government not to recognise that, by not allowing my amendment, is really disappointing.”

The peer ridiculed the idea of extra costs, saying: “They are minuscule, just one or two people to work at the commission – we are not talking about millions of pounds.”

Mr Parish agreed, saying: “The commission isn’t costing anything at the moment, so I don’t see why we need a separate money resolution for it to be extended to look at new trade deals.”

Ms Truss was forced to concede the setting up of the body in the summer, but it can only advise the government and will be wound up after six months.

The amendment would retain it for four years and make it truly independent. Supporters believe it would, if given real teeth, never sanction lower standards, achieving the “same objective” as an outright legal guarantee.

MPs will vote on Monday on a separate amendment, passed in the Lords, to impose that strict legal bar on diluting existing standards, but it is thought to be less likely to pass.

Ms Truss has argued the Agriculture Bill is the wrong vehicle for such a move, instead urging MPs to trust the government when it says it will not cut standards.

However, critics believe she simply does not want her hands tied – noting the UK proposed allowing in chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef in the US trade talks, albeit with higher tariffs.

In the Commons on Thursday, Ms Truss criticised a “blanket ban” on food products not complying with British farming regulations, telling MPs: “I want to make sure our farmers are able to continue with their high standards, but I don't want to stop developing countries exporting their goods to us.”

The controversy comes after Jamie Oliver stepped up his warning of an influx of cheap food if ministers are able to prevent “proper parliamentary scrutiny”, saying: “I don’t like the smell of it.”

“All we’re asking for is debate in Parliament and not a backdoor to do a quick deal. We’re asking for honest, clear, lawful debate,” the celebrity chef told the BBC.

The US has made opening the door to its lower-grade agricultural goods a red line. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said it must be part of any deal, during a visit in January.

A government spokesperson declined to discuss why ministers were using the manoeuvre to block a vote, but insisted that the government had “been clear it will not sign a trade deal that will compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”.

The spokesperson said that “claims to the contrary are unhelpful scaremongering” and insisted the UK was a “world leader” in the field.

They added: “Chlorinated chicken and hormone injected beef are not permitted for import into the UK. This will be retained through the EU Withdrawal Act and enshrined in UK law at the end of the transition period.

“The government is focused on getting trade deals that protect and advance the interests of our farmers and consumers. If a deal isn’t the right one, we will walk away.”",obscure rule is to be used to deny MPs a crucial vote aimed at blocking imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. move to prevent debate on a key amendment expected to be backed by tories in a commons showdown on Monday has been condemned as 'unbelievable' by the peer who introduced it.

Lawson, former chairman of the Vote Leave pro-Brexit campaign, who lives in the Gers department of the south west, has like, many Britons living in France, moved to secure his status on this side of the Channel given all the uncertainty provoked by Brexit.

Lawson, who lives permanently in the 18th century country house he owns, told The Connexion newspaper that he is applying for a carte de séjour - which is considered the best way Britons can secure their futures in France before Brexit.

Lawson, who once said ""I love Europe, that's why I live in France' believes Britain's exit from the EU should come at any cost.

He told The Connexion that the extra red tape Brits in France will have to overcome because of Brexit was ""tiresome"" rather than ""serious"".

""There may be a few bureaucratic hoops to be gone through, which are tiresome, but I don’t think it’s a serious problems,"" he said.

“I know Americans who live for varying lengths of time in France and they find things perfectly tolerable.”

But news of the Brexiteer's carte de séjour application did not go down well among some Brits in France where there was even talk of setting up petitions to try to persuade French authorities to turn down his application. Many hoped Lawson's local prefecture in Auch simply turn his application down.

The former UK chancellor has long provoked the wrath of those against Brexit who have regularly pointed out that Lawson took advantage of the EU's freedom of movement to move to France but then wanted to take it away from future generations.

Debra Archer from the Remain in France Together anti-Brexit group summed up why many were angry.

""He lives in France and benefits from the EU and yet he advocated for the UK to leave it,"" she told The Local.

""He assures us there is no reason to worry and we will be able to continue life as before - and yet he is applying for a carte de séjour to make sure his residence here is documented before the UK leaves.

""Does this mean he expects the UK to crash out with no deal and no citizens' rights agreement or is it just that he feels insecure along with the rest of us and would rather have an EU document to prove his rights than rely on the UK government to secure them?""

Lawson, who once said ""I love Europe, that's why I live in France' believes Britain's exit from the EU should come at any cost but told The Connexion newspaper that the extra red tape Brits in France will have to overcome because of Brexit was ""tiresome rather than serious"".

""There may be a few bureaucratic hoops to be gone through, which are tiresome, but I don’t think it’s a serious problem.

“I know Americans who live for varying lengths of time in France and they find things perfectly tolerable.”

Russell Hall, who lives in the Dordogne added: ""What annoys so many of us is his extraordinarily blasé and casual attitude. Perhaps his wealth and privilege protect him from the chaos and disruption that will affect so many more humble Brits who have chosen to live in France, either full time or part of each year.

""It beggars belief that as many of those seeking a carte de séjour in France struggle to satisfy the many criteria and to assemble the substantial documentation in support of their application, Lord Lawson airily dismisses their concerns, saying he is ""not particularly worried. It comes under the category of tiresome rather than serious.""

And amply justified. I hope the préfecture in Auch will cast the coldest eye on his application. https://t.co/pD7YQhdcEc — Brendan McCarthy (@breandanmcc) May 31, 2018

Lawson's fellow British nationals living in France have been rushing to acquire the residency permits which, although not obligatory given they are still EU citizens, is seen as one way of avoiding future paperwork and red tape once Britain leaves the EU.

The Local reported previously how some departments in France were turning Brits away telling them there was no need to apply until Britain officially left the EU.

According to campaigners France's Ministry of Interior has since issued a reminder to all prefectures around France that Britons have the right to apply and their applications should not be turned away. The Ministry encouraged Britons to apply now to avoid the rush further down the line.

Brits who are in France and those who arrive before the end of the Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020 have been told they will have the right to stay in France but they, like EU citizens in the UK, may be forced to apply for some kind of ""settled status"" residency permit.

Lawson isn't actually alone in being a Brexit supporting Brit who is living in France.

While happily choosing to live in France and within the EU but voting for Britain to be independent might seem like a contradiction to many, things are a little more complicated than that.

Many Brits in France voted to leave the EU, much to the anger and confusion of remain supporters.","ex-vote leave pro-Brexit lawson is applying for a carte de séjour. he says it is the best way to secure futures in France before Brexit. but he says the extra bureaucratic hoops will be ""tiresome"" rather than ""serious"""

In early 2016, Darren Grimes, a 21-year-old fashion student from Durham, set up a social media campaign to encourage young people to vote to leave the European Union. ""BeLeave"" raised the princely sum of £21.51 in three months.

Then, in the two weeks before the Brexit referendum, Grimes received a series of massive donations, including £625,000 from the Vote Leave campaign. This money, it was subsequently discovered, was paid directly to a Canadian data analytics firm called Aggregate IQ. It was never even resting in the young student's account.

On Tuesday, the UK's elections watchdog reported Grimes and a senior Vote Leave executive to the police. In a stinging report, the Electoral Commission found that Vote Leave had broken the law by failing to include Grimes's spending in their return.

The official Leave campaign breached spending limits by almost half a million pounds. That’s a significant amount in British politics, especially in a knife-edge referendum like Brexit.

Nor is this the first time that the British elections regulator has found serious irregularities in how the campaign to leave the EU was won.

In May, another pro-Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined £70,000, again for breaking electoral law. Leave.EU was bankrolled by Arron Banks, a controversial businessman who emerged from obscurity to become the biggest donor in British political history, giving more than £8 million to pro-Brexit groups.

Russian ambassador

The extent and source of Banks’s fortune has been under discussion, as have his political connections. Recent reports revealed that Banks had extensive, previously undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador in London in the run-up to the Brexit vote.

Then, on the night of the referendum former Ukip leader Nigel Farage twice conceded defeat live on British television. When the results came in sterling's value collapsed, and a number of prominent pro-Brexit hedge fund managers made millions.

Broadcasters are responding to an environment in which almost any information that might challenge the narrative of 'the people have spoken' is decried as politically motivated

So, what has been the response in Britain to all this? A parliamentary inquiry? Politicians on all sides demanding changes to electoral law to protect the democratic processes?

Not exactly. On Tuesday, Conservative MP Nadine Dorries accused the Electoral Commission – an independent regulator – of being biased.

Dorries, who infamously took a sabbatical in the I'm a Celebrity jungle, is often a fringe Tory voice but not this time. News that the largest Brexit campaign broke the law has provoked hardly a peep from the party of government.

The opposition benches have scarcely been much louder. With a few honourable exceptions, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has been largely silent, no doubt wary of being seen to oppose “the will of the people”.

To say that Brexit has paralysed British politics is hardly a searing insight. Hours before the Electoral Commission's Vote Leave report was released, Theresa May was forced into an embarrassing climbdown in the Commons on key aspects of her Chequers plan.

At present, it’s hard to see who wield more power: the prime minister or the hardline European Research Group’s priggish leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg.

Simplistic slogans

But it is not just Britain’s parliament that has been incapacitated by Brexit. Almost every aspect of British public life is now refracted through the simplistic slogans of June 2016.

Take the media. Ordinarily news that the largest campaign in British political history had broken the law would be met with headlines excoriating Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – both senior figures in Vote Leave – and calling for full investigations.

But these are not ordinary times. In a climate where some newspaper front pages have declared judges “the enemies of the people” and called on May to “crush the saboteurs”, there is a marked reluctance to pose awkward questions about how the referendum was won.

This tendency is particularly notable in the BBC. The corporation allowed Vote Leave's former head honcho Matthew Elliott to issue a rebuttal of the Electoral Commission's charges a full two weeks ago, well before the report had even been released.

Broadcasters are responding to a wider environment within which almost any information that might challenge the narrative of “the people have spoken” is decried as politically motivated. Northern Ireland-born Labour MP Kate Hoey dismissed the Electoral Commission report as the work of jaundiced Remainers. In the next breath, she said she had not actually read it.

Democratic poverty

Brexit has revealed the poverty of the system that regulates British democracy. The Electoral Commission itself only looked in depth at Vote Leave after internal emails released under Freedom of Information legislation showed that the watchdog was deeply uneasy about the campaign’s spending but was wary of launching a full investigation.

Some anti-Brexit campaigners hope the news will force the UK government to reassess the whole project. That's highly unlikely

Even now that Vote Leave has been found to have broken the law, little is likely to change. The fines levied are tiny in comparison with the stakes involved: Vote Leave’s fine represents less than 1 per cent of the total spending.

There seems little chance of anyone ending up in prison or of meaningful reform of Britain’s election laws. Meanwhile, putatively Conservative voices such as Rees-Mogg routinely attack public institutions, from the courts to the election regulator.

Some anti-Brexit campaigners hope the news will force the UK government to reassess the whole project. That’s highly unlikely. Remarkably, unlike a general election, the victory in the referendum cannot be challenged in an election court because the vote was not legally binding.

Brexit means Brexit. But does Brexit mean ignoring mounting evidence that the democratic process was compromised during the 2016 referendum? If that’s the case, then Britain could be living with the consequences of the vote to leave the EU long, long after March 2019.

Peter Geoghegan is an investigative journalist with news website openDemocracy","a 21-year-old fashion student from Durham set up a campaign to encourage young people to vote to leave the european union. he received a series of massive donations, including £625,000 from the Vote Leave campaign. the official Leave campaign breached spending limits by almost half a million pounds."
