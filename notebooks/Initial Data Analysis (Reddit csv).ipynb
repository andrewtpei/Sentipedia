That's what labour did in the last election.

The tories got 56% of the seats with 43.6% of the votes having gained 7.5% of seats with a 1.2 percentage point swing in votes. This is with a protest vote over brexit and the relentless vilification of Corbyn by the press. It won\u0019t be long before people hit back and vote against the tories but if Scotland do ever leave the union then it will be a lot less likely.   \n",

Arguably the issue with the Tories is still about Austerity, the failure to properly fund social support, the mess they made in terms of governance, the corruption, the utterly piss poor approach to large parts of the Covid response and so on...\\n\\nBut brexit doesn't really fit the bill as an example why they should 'never ever' vote conservative, especially if in a few years time (As seems pretty likely) the UK isn't worse off and future governments have more scope to act in the UK's interests outside of the EU than they did inside it? If the EU continues down its current role (or worse, we see more right leaning governments push the EU in that direction) I'm not sure that no longer being part of it will be seen as a bad thing by most.  Labour\\n\\nFar from the notion that has been bounced around that in a few years leave supporters will be saying they were actually remainers, it seems far more likely that people will try to minimise their own positions and leaving the EU will be seen as just another step along the way..   \n",

No. I dont see Scottish independence going away any time soon which will be a direct consequence of Brexit. The possible / probable break up of the UK isn't something you move on from because Boris got some paperwork. \\n\\nA small and limited agreement does nothing for this or a huge number of other issues. Move on from Brexit once the full consequences are known.   \n",

First it was the 350 billion we send to the EU, which was a lie. Then it was fish and the whole sovereignty business, ie why are EU boats in our waters and why does the EU make our laws? On these two you can at least say that brexit has succeeded, not what was promised, but still technically succeeded.\\n\\nAnd that's enough honestly for Boris to claim a victory. Looking over the deal, it seems to mostly give every variety of brexiteer at least partially what they wanted. Most brexiteer's accept that there will be hardship to come but in the end it will all be worth it. They're not idiots.   \n",

Were they not aware of that consequence? Were they not willing to endure that hardship to do the right thing for the country?\\n\\nI suspect a lot of Brexiters were happy to let other people become poorer as the price of Brexit, but when they themselves start to suffer they will be looking for the rest of us to bail them out.   \n",

We left the EU at the start of the year, the new agreement is something I haven't yet read but will (yes I'm that sad).  The time has come for us to accept it, move forward and make the best of it.   \n",

I can't remember the name of the book but ultimately you can either see something as being done to you, or be the change and be part of it.  The latter being something you are in control of and makes you feel better. Don't like something then e-mail an MP.  They will probably fob you off but you will feel better.  I did that recently on another subject for the first time (in Scotland) and of the 8 MSPs that represent me 2 got back.  Did I achieve anything - realistically no.  Did I make my opinion heard - yes.  If we continue to see Brexit as a horrible thing being done to us then the only thing that is going to happen is that we all become depressed.  Embrace what is happening, accept it, and declare what you want to see happen and you will feel more in control.  Will you get what you want - maybe, maybe not but you will have tried and have had someone listen and that is the most important thing imho.   \n",

Brexit has allowed a certain rhetoric to spread and I can\u0019t stand the constant support of the conservatives, especially from people in run down parts of the country. It\u0019s so stupid to me that people gave the Tories their vote in 2019 because they were so desperate for Brexit, when the Tories don\u0019t care about the working class and never will. \\n\\nIt\u0019ll be interesting to see how this all plays out next year.   \n",

Also I will get my job back which eastern Europe stole with my tax money. Brexit will make GB into a sunny paradise like the California hills and valleys of Trump ruled USA.

The Tory establishment was against brexit, boiling it down into purely party politics is just wrong. It's also true that brexit was just popular in working class, traditionally Labour areas as it was in rural Tory areas. If you look at the results it roughly three quarters of Tory constituencies voted leave compared to two thirds of Labour constituencies. Those Labour areas didn't vote for brexit because they were part of some loyal Tory block.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;Change will only come when that non-voter apathy is reversed, but as decreasing turnouts are currently a global phenomenon, it's unlikely to be anytime soon. \\n\\nI guess you missed the fact that turnout has been increasing in the UK in every general election after 2001 with the exception of 2019 which was slightly down but because it was a winter election and even then it was still the second highest turnout in the 21st century.\\n\\n\\nFor someone saying \"the numbers are there to see\", you don't have a very good grasp on the numbers   \n",

Free prescriptions for all, free education for all including at some of the most prestigious universities in the world, the lowest rate of unemployment of the UK nations, a fairer and more tolerant society than in any other nation in the UK, open support for minorities, immigration, LGBT+ rights, a real campaign against hate crime, the only serious voice countering austerity and Brexit in the UK... Turning the murder capital of Europe into a safe, inclusive city with a bright future... Truly they have achieved very very little!   \n",

It's almost like several parties came together and decided on a pre election pact and joint manifesto. There's clear divisions in both the Tories and Labour. In another country with PR and multi seat constituencies you might see more parties e.g. Momentum as it's own party. You might see UKIP take some seats with some current Tory hard Brexiteers on board (I don't really know, I'm just throwing out some ideas) Coalitions mean compromise - but a lot of the time the smaller parties take the brunt of the electorates ire when things go wrong.   \n",
                            "46  &gt;you can't really apply that logic to the NI parties because the biggest UK parties don't run candidates in NI.\\n\\nThe Tories run candidates in NI - they've been thanklessly trying to persuade them to vote non-sectarian since 1979.\\n\\nThe best part of a constituency FPTP election with just 100,000 voters is the direct relationship with the constituents.\\n\\nIn places with PR, seats are allocated according to a list. Thus sucking up to the party bosses is more important than winning over your constituents, as if you suck up properly you are towards the top of the list and get elected even if you don't bother to canvass your ward.\\n\\nLook at Italy for the mess that type of system produces. FPTP does allow for independent minded constituency MPs. Dennis Skinner (or Corbyn) would not have survived in a list PR system when Blair was their party leader. They were kept in place by FPTP and the fact their constituents liked them.\\n\\nAnd look at Israel for the mess that a pure PR system produces - the king makers are extremists and the majority is utterly helpless.\\n\\nFinally, you can make big change in a FPTP system - look at Brexit. UKIP didn't have to actually win any seats. They just needed to take enough votes from Tories so they lost to Labour to focus minds.\\n\\nWe saw something similar in 1989 with the Greens following the ozone crisis. Mrs Thatcher was already trying to get a deal to ban CFCs, but the performance of the Greens allowed her to silence members in her own party who had been lobbied by manufacturers to keep CFCs.\\n\\nThe only place where I have seen FPTP go badly wrong is the French Presidential elections. Essentially it's First Two Past the Post i the first round, and Macron and Le Pen got 45% of the vote between them. The problem there was the electorate was too big, so diverse voices were not heard.\\n\\nThat's not a problem when you are doing 650 FPTP contests where the electorate in each contest is no more than 100,000 voters.   \n",
