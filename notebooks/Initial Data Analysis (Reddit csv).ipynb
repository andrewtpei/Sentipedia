The tories got 56% of the seats with 43.6% of the votes having gained 7.5% of seats with a 1.2 percentage point swing in votes. This is with a protest vote over brexit and the relentless vilification of Corbyn by the press.

The tories got 56% of the seats with 43.6% of the votes having gained 7.5% of seats with a 1.2 percentage point swing in votes. This is with a protest vote over brexit and the relentless vilification of Corbyn by the press. It won\u0019t be long before people hit back and vote against the tories but if Scotland do ever leave the union then it will be a lot less likely.   \n",
